We prove that the moments of fluctuations normalized by n−1/2 in the limit n→satisfy the Wick relations for the Gaussian random variables. This allows us to prove central limit theorem for Tr Gzand then extend the result on the linear eigenvalue statistics Tr Aof any function :R→R which increases, together with its first two derivatives, at infinity not faster than an exponential. c 2010 American Institute of Physics. doi:10.1063/1.3299297I. INTRODUCTION Random graphs appear in different branches of mathematics and physics see Refs. 4 and 12 and references therein. It is well known that they are closely connected with the theory of random matrices, since there is one to one map between graphs with n vertices and their adjacency matrices recall that by the definition the entries aij of the adjacency matrix are 1 if the vertices i and j are connected and aij=0 otherwise. Commonly, the set of n eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix is referred to as the spectrum of the graph. The limit when the dimension of the matrix n the number of the vertexes of the graphstends to infinity provides a natural approximation for the spectral properties of random graphs. One of the classes of the prime reference in the theory of random graphs is the binomial random graph originating by Erdős see, e.g., Ref. 12. Given a number pn0,1, this family of graphs Gn, pnis defined by taking the set of all graphs on n vertices as the space of events with probability, PG= pn eG1 − pnn2 −eG, 1.1where eGis the number of edges of G. Most of the random graph studies are devoted to the cases where pn→0 as n→. Ensemble of random symmetric nn adjacency matrices A corresponding to 1.1can be represented as A=aiji,j=1 n with aii=0, and independent and identically distributed aij = 1, with probability pn 0, with probability 1 − pn. 1.2For any measurable function f we denote EfAthe averaging with respect to all random variables aij1ijn and aElectronic mail: shcherbi@ilt.kharkov.ua. bElectronic mail: b.tirozzi@livero.it.

VarfAªEfA− EfA2. 1.3The normalized eigenvalue counting measure of A is defined by the formula Nn= n−1 j:jn. The ensemble of adjacency matrices 1.2is a particular case of the random matrix theory, where the limiting transition n→is intensively studied during half of century since the pioneering works by Wigner.23 Spectral properties of random adjacency matrix 1.2were examined in the limit n→both in numerical and theoretical physics studies.7-9,18-20 There are two major asymptotic regimes: pn1/n and pn=O1/nand corresponding models can be called dilute random matrices and sparse random matrices, respectively. The first studies of spectral properties of sparse and dilute random matrices in the physical literature are related with Refs. 19, 20, and 18, where equations for the limiting density of states of sparse random matrices were derived. In Refs. 18 and 10 a number of important results on the universality of the correlation functions and the Anderson localization transition were obtained. Unfortunately these results were obtained with the nonrigorous replica and supersymmetry methods. On mathematical level of rigor the eigenvalue distribution of dilute random matrices was studied in Ref. 14. It was shown that the normalized eigenvalue counting measure of npn−1/2A converges in the limit npn→to the distribution of explicit form known as the semicircle, or Wigner law.23 In Ref. 5 the adjacency matrix of random graphs 1.1with pn=pn−1 was studied. It was shown that for any m there exist nonrandom limiting moments limn→n−1 Tr Anm and these moments can be found from the system of certain recurrent relations. The results of Ref. 5 was generalized to the case of weighted random graphs in Ref. 15, where the resolvent of the adjacency matrix was studied and equations for the Stieltjes transform gzof the limiting eigenvalue distribution were derived rigorously note that the same equation for Gaussian weights was obtained in Refs. 19, 20, and 18 by using the replica and the supersymmetry approaches.It was shown in Ref. 15 that to prove the existence of the limit limn→gnz=gz, where gnzis the Stieltjes transform of the normalized counting function Nn, gnz= dNn− z , 1.4we need to study the behavior of the function, fnz,u= 1nk=1 n e−uGkkz, 1.5where Gjkz= z − iAjk −1. 1.6The function fnz ,uis defined for any u, z, such that Rz0. In what follows it will be important for us that GRz−1, j=1 n Gij2 = GGii G2 Rz−2, RGe,eRz 0, ∀ e Rn⇒e−uGe,e1, if uRz 0. 1.7Here and everywhere below Ameans the operator norm of the matrix A. The following theorem proven in Ref. 15gives us the limiting properties of fnz ,uof 1.5. Theorem 1: Consider the adjacency matrix (1.2) with pn=p/n. Then for any u, z such that uRz0 we have the following. 023523-2 M. Shcherbina and B. Tirozzi J. Math. Phys. 51, 023523 2010Downloaded 16 Apr 2011 to 158.250.33.122.

(i) The variance of the function fnz ,udefined by (1.5) vanishes in the limit n→, Varfnz,uC/Rz2n. 1.8(ii) There exists the limit lim n→Efnz,u= fz,u, Efnz,u− fz,uCu1/2/Rzn1/2. 1.9(iii) If we consider a class H of functions which are analytic in z :Rz0 and for any fixed z :Rz0 possessing the norm fz= max u0 fz,u1 + u , 1.10then the limiting function is the unique solution in H of the functional equation, fz,u= 1 − u1/2e−p0dvJ12uvv exp− zv + pfz,v, 1.11where J1is the Bessel function, J1= 2k=0 − 2/4k k!k + 1! . 1.12One can easily see that − u fnz,uu=0 = 1nk=1 n EGkkz= 1nETr Gz= Eign− iz, where gnzis the Stieltjes transform 1.4of the normalized counting measure Nn. Hence, Theorem 1 implies that for any z :Iz0, lim n→Egnz− Egnz2= 0, 1.13i.e., the fluctuations of gnzvanish in the limit n→. Moreover, 1.9implies that gz= lim n→Egnz= − u fz,uu=0. 1.14Since the Stieltjes transform uniquely determines the measure, it follows from Theorem 1 that there exists the weak limit Nof the normalized counting measure Nnand the Stieltjes transform g−izcan be obtained as the first derivative of the solution of 1.11. Using Theorem 1 it is not difficult to obtain the asymptotic expansions for gzwith respect to z−k. Since it is well known that the coefficients of this expansion are the moments of the limiting normalized counting measure of eigenvalues, we obtain the recurrent formulas for the moments. Besides, constructing the asymptotic expansion of gzwith respect to pk, it is easy to show that this expansion is convergent for p1. Since in the case aij=0,1 the coefficients of this expansion are rational functions of z, we can conclude that the limiting spectrum is pure point and consists of the spectra of finite blocks only. Results of Ref. 15 described above can be viewed as the analogs of the law of large numbers for linear eigenvalue statistics, 023523-3 CLT for eigenvalue statistics of random graphs J. Math.

Nn=i=1 n i= Tr A, 1.15corresponding to continuous test functions. Indeed, it follows from 1.13and 1.14that for any continuous test function there exists lim n→n−1Nn= dN, where N is the limiting normalized counting measure of eigenvalues. In the present paper we consider the central limit theorem CLT, the second element of the standard probabilistic analysis of linear statistics. Similar questions for other ensembles of random matrices were studied in Refs. 2, 3, 11, 13, 16, 21, and 22. Note, however, that for almost all ensembles studied in the random matrix theory, like the Wigner ensemble, the Marchenko-Pastur ensemble, the matrix models, etc., the variance of linear statistics for smooth functions is bounded see Refs. 2, 3, 11, 13, 16, 17, 21, and 22. Thus, for these ensembles, one expects the CLT to be valid for statistics themselves, i.e., without an n-dependent normalization factor in front. This has to be compared with the case of independent and identically distributed random variables with finite second moment, where the variance of linear statistics is always of the order On, n→and the CLT is valid for linear statistics divided by n1/2. As we will see below this is the case also for the ensemble of sparse adjacency matrices 1.2with pn=p/n. The aim of the present paper is to study the fluctuations of linear eigenvalue statistics for different classes of test functions. Following the method of Ref. 15 we study first the functions fnz ,udefined in 1.5and prove that its fluctuations converge in distribution to the complex Gaussian random variables. Define the mth generalized moment of the fluctuations of fnz ,u, Mm,nz1,u1; . . . ;zm,umªn−m/2Ej=1 m k=1 n e'−ujGkkzj= nm/2Ej=1 m f ' nzj,uj, Rzi 0. 1.16Here and below for any random variable we denote ' = − E. Theorem 2: Consider the adjacency matrix ensemble (1.2) with pn=p/n. Let Mm,nz1 ,u1 ; . . . ; zm,umm=2,3,...of (1.16) be the "moments" of the fluctuations of fnz ,uof (1.5). Then for any m2 and z1 , . . . , zm:Rzj0 there exists Mmz1,u1; . . . ;zm,umª lim n→Mm,nz1,u1; . . . ;zm,um. 1.17Moreover, the following recursion equations hold: Mmz1,u1; . . . ;zm,um=j=2 m M2z1,u1;zj,ujMm−2z2,u2; . . . ;zj−1,uj−1;zj+1,uj+1; . . . ;zm,um. 1.18Theorem 2 can be used to prove the CLT for fluctuations of the trace of Gzof 1.6. Indeed, if we denote Mm,n z1, . . . ,zmªn−m/2ETrG ' z1¯TrG ' zm, 1.19then it is easy to see that 023523-4 M. Shcherbina and B. Tirozzi J. Math.

Mm,n z1, . . . ,zm= m u1 . . . umMmz1,u1; . . . ;zm,umu1=. . .=um=0. Since Mmz1 ,u1 ; . . . ; zm,umare evidently analytic in each ui in some neighborhood of ui=0 and bounded uniformly in n for any fixed z1 , . . . , zm Rzi0see Lemma 1 below, we pass to the limit n→in the above relations and obtain the following theorem. Theorem 3: Let Gzbe the resolvent (1.6) of the sparse adjacency matrix (1.2) with pn =p/n. Then for any m2 and z1 , . . . , zm:Rzj0 there exists Mm z1, . . . ,zmª lim n→Mm,n z1; . . . ;zm1.20and the following recursions hold: Mm z1, . . . ,zm=j=2 m M2 z1,zjMm−2 z2, . . . ,zj−1,zj+1, . . . ,zm. 1.21Theorem 3 by a standard way implies the CLT for vnz=n−1/2 TrG ' z. Indeed, if we put in 1.20and 1.21z1=z2=¯=zm=z, then Theorem 3 yields that there exist limits of all moments of the complex random variable vnzand M2mzªlim En−1/2 TrG ' z2m= 2m − 1!!M2zm. This means that vnzconverges in distribution to a complex Gaussian random variable with zero mean and variance M2z. It is possible also to derive from Theorem 3 the CLT for the linear eigenvalue statistics of any function which grows not faster than an exponent at infinity and possesses two derivatives with the same property, i.e., there exists a constant c0, such that ,,L2R,cosh−2c. Here and below L2R,w= f:R f2wd. 1.22Theorem 4: Consider the adjacency matrix (1.2) with pn=p/n and take any function which possesses two derivatives such that ,,L2R,cosh−2cwith some constant c0. Then the random variable n−1/2N' nconverges in distribution to a Gaussian random variable with zero mean and variance Vªlim n→Varn−1/2Nn. It is clear from the above discussion that Theorem 2 plays a key role in the paper because Theorems 3 and 4 are, in fact, corollaries of Theorem 2. The proof of Theorem 2 is based on a version of the cavity method which has been used many times for proving different limiting relations of statistical mechanics and random matrices. The idea is to compare the behavior of the object function e.g., free-energy, resolvent, etc.for the complete system of random variables of the problem and the one with some subset of random variables replaced by 0. Let us try to explain the connections among the lemmas and propositions which are necessary for the proof of Theorem 2. The proof should be seen as a logical sequence of the following steps. : We prove first bounds on Mm,nz1 ,u1 ; . . . ; zm,umuniform in z1 ,u1 ; . . . ; zm,umRzjC 0see Lemma 1. One uses the norm estimates of the martingale theory Proposition 1, identities for the resolvent, and the cavity method consisting in studying the difference of the resolvent of the full matrix and the same matrix without the first line and the first column. : To prove the convergence of the variance of the sums of exponentials we need to generalize Theorem 1 and to show the existence of the limits of exponentials multiplied by some entire functions cf. Lemma 2 and Theorem 1. The proof of Lemma 2 is based on the relations for some functions of A given by Proposition 2. 023523-5 CLT for eigenvalue statistics of random graphs J. Math.

: Lemma 3 proves the self-averaging properties and the existence of the limits for the terms which will appear in the proof of CLT. : Finally we prove that the "moments" 1.16as functions of ui satisfy the linear integral equations with the kernel defined in terms of the function f of 1.11see 2.54. Since we are able to prove that these equations are uniquely solvable for RzM0 with some fixed M0, we finish the proof of Theorem 2. II. PROOFS We start from the lemma which gives bounds for Mm,n. Lemma 1: For any mN and z1 , . . . , zm:Rzj0 there exists a constant Cm, such that uniformly in u1 . . . ,um0 , Mm,nz1,u1; . . . ;zm,umCm. 2.1The proof is based on the martingale property of the sequence of averages of the functions of the random matrix A with respect to its rows or columns. The sequence is ordered with respect to the index of the rows and the proposition below is based on the sequence of the conditional expectations like in the proof of self-averaging of the free-energy for disordered systems. Proposition 1: Let , =1, . . . ,be independent random variables, assuming values in Rmand having probability laws P, =1, . . . ,, and let :Rm1¯Rm→C be a Borelian function. Set 1, . . . ,= 1, . . . ,,+1, . . . ,P+1d+1. . . Pd2.2so that =, 0=E, where E¯denotes the expectation with respect to the product measure P1¯P. Then for any positive p1 there exists Cp, independent of and such that E− E2pCpp−1=1 E− −12p. 2.3Moreover, if for every =1, . . . ,there exists a -independent :Rm1¯Rm→C, such that E− 2pC, = 1, . . . ,, 2.4then E− E2p2CpCp. 2.5Proof: The proof of 2.3is given in Ref. 6. Hence, we show only how to derive 2.4from 2.3. It follows from 2.2and 2.4that the integrals of with respect to P+1¯Pand PP+1¯Pcoincide and we obtain E− −12p22p−1E− −12p+ E− 2p22pE− 2p. This and 2.3prove 2.5. Proof of Lemma 1: The Hölder inequality yields Mm,nz1,u1; . . . ;zm,umnm/2j=1 m Ef ' nzj,ujm1/m. Hence, it suffices to prove the bound for the right hand side of the above inequality. For this we use Proposition 1 for the function =nfnz ,uwith fnz ,uof 1.5. According to 2.5and the 023523-6 M.

approach of the cavity method for our purposes it is enough to choose the functions i independent of i=aiªai1 , . . . ,aii−1,0,aii+1 , . . . ,ainand prove 2.4. Set Ai= Aaij=0,j=1,. . .,n, Giz= z − iAi−1, 2.6i= nfn iz,uªki e−uGkk iz. 2.7By the symmetry reason it suffices to prove 2.4for i=1. We use the representations Gijz= Gij 1z− G1a1iG1a1j z + G1a1,a1, i, j 1, G1jz= iG1a1j z + G1a1,a1, j 1, G11z= z + G1a1,a1−1, 2.8where a1=0,a12, . . . ,a1n. The inequality ex−eyx−ymaxex, eyand 1.7imply k=2 e−uGkk − e−uGkk 1uk=2 Gkk − Gkk 1uk G1a1kG1a1k z + G1a1,a1= uG1za1,G1za1z + G1a1,a1. 2.9But the spectral theorem yields G1za1,G1za1=j=1 n j,a12 j− Iz2 + Rz2 = 1 RzRG1a1,a1, where A1j=jj. Thus, since by 1.7RzRG1a1,a10, we have G1za1,G1za1z + G1a1,a1Rz−1. 2.10Inequality 2.4for our choice of and ifollows from 2.9and 2.10. In the proof of Theorem 2 we will replace sometimes Mm,n by the moments independent of a1,jj=2 n . Set Mm,n 1z1,u1; . . . ;zm,umªnm/2Ej=1 m f 'n 1zj,uj, 2.11with fn1of 2.7. Note that 2.9yields that for any mN and z1 , . . . , zm:Rzj0 there exists constants Cm,Cm , such that uniformly in u1 , . . . ,um Mm,nz1,u1; . . . ;zm,um− Mm,n 1z1,u1; . . . ;zm,umCmn−1/2, Mm,n 1z1,u1; ¯ ;zm,umCm . 2.12To study the behavior of some functions, depending on a1,jj=2 n , we use the following proposition.

We need below the trivial bounds, ea − eba − bmaxea,eb, ea − eb − a − ba − b2maxea,eb. 2.15The first bound and the second line of 1.7combined with 2.8imply e−vG1a1,a1− e−vkGkk 1a1kvk1k2 Gk1k2 1a1k1a1k2.

Repeating the argument used for I3,m, we obtain I4,m = 00dv1dv2v1m−1J12uv2v2m − 1! e−zv1+v2e−p+pfz,v1+v2Tmv1 + v2+ r3,m,r4,mu2 Cmn−1/2. 2.35Collecting the above relations, we get in view of 2.31the equation Tmu= mu+K ˆ mTmu+ rmu, rmuCm1 + un−1/2, where the function muis defined by the right hand side of 2.32and 2.33and the integral operator K ˆ m is defined by the right hand side of 2.34and 2.35. It is easy to see that for Rz 2 the operator norm in the Banach space of the functions with the norm 1.10satisfies the inequality K ˆ mq 1. Hence, we get 2.28. Then summing with respect to m and taking into account the bounds for the remainder terms, we obtain 2.23. The next lemma is a technical one. We will use it in the proof of Theorem 2 below.

Indeed, according to 2.30we have T0uªE1e−uG11= 1 − u1/2E10dvJ12uvv e−vz+G1a1,a1. Then, averaging with respect to a1,isimilarly to 2.32, we get T0u= 1 − u0dvJ12uvv e−vze−p+pfz,v+ r0, Er02C/n. To prove the second bound of 2.37we use 2.14, which gives us that E1D1−e−uG11 1coincides with the right hand side of 2.14. Then 2.30for u˜ =iGjk 12u applied to the right hand side of 2.14yields E1D1− e−uG11 1= ipu n 0dvj,l e−uGjj 1Gjl 1J12iuvGjl 1v e−zv−p+pfn 1z,v+ Oqueu/n1/2= p20dvv−1VJ,nz,u,uve−zv−p+pfz,v+ Oecu/n1/2, with VJ,n of 2.21. Now the second inequality of 2.37follows from Lemma 2, if we use 2.30to integrate the bound for rJ,nz ,u,uvof 2.24with respect to v. The third bound of 2.37follows from the first and the second one. Relations 2.39and 2.40can be proven if we repeat the argument 2.31-2.35and then apply Lemma 2. Now we are ready to prove Theorem 2. Proof of Theorem 2: Fix z1 , . . . , zm such that Rzi2, i=1, . . . ,m. We find first M2,n. Using the symmetry of the problem and Lemma 1 it is easy to see that M2,n = nEe'−u1G11z1f 'n 1z2,u2+ Ee'−u1G11z1D '1z2,u2= T1 + Vnz1,u1;z2,u2, 2.41where Vnz1 ,u1 ; z2 ,u2is defined in Lemma 3.

Since f ' n1z2 ,u2does not depend on a1jj=2 n we can average with respect to a1and similarly to 2.16obtain E1rvCv + v2/n. We used 2.17and the first bound of 1.7for G1.

Then, integrating with respect to v recall that J11see Ref. 1and averaging ke−vGkk 1a1k over a1k, we get similarly to 2.32T1 = − nu1 1/20dvJ12u1vv e−z1v−pEf 'n 1z2,u2ke−vGkk 1a1k+ Ou1 1/2 n1/2= − nu1 1/20dvJ12u1vv e−z1v−pEf 'n 1z2,u2epfn 1z1,v+ Ou1 1/2 n1/2. Writing fn1z1 ,v=Efn1z1 ,v+f ' n1z1 ,v, we have T1 = − nu1 1/20dvJ12u1vv e−z1v−pEf 'n 1z2,u2epEfn 1z1,v+pf'n 1z1,v+ rn 2= n0dvKnu1,v;z1Ef 'n 1z2,u2f 'n 1z1,v+ Of 'n 1z1,v2+ rn 2= 0dvKnu1,v;z1M2,nz1,v;z2,u2+ rn 3, 2.43where Knu1,v;z1ª− pu1 1/2J12u1vv e−z1v−peEpfn 1v,z, rn 2= Ou1/n1/2, rn 3= rn 2+ n0dvKnu1,v;z1Ef 'n 1z2,u2Of 'n 1z1,v2Cn−1/2u1 1/2. 2.44The last bound follows from 2.12. Thus, we obtain that M2,nz1,u1;z2,u2= 0dvKnu1,v;z1M2,n 1z1,v;z2,u2+ Vnz1,u1;z2,u2+ rn 3z1,u1;z2,u2+ On−1/2, 2.45where Vnz1 ,u1 ; z2 ,u2is defined in 2.38.

M2,nz1,u1;z2,u2= 0dvKu1,v;z1M2,n 1z1,v;z2,u2+ Vz1,u1;z2,u2+ rn 4z1,u1;z2,u2+ On−1/2, rn 4z1,u1;z2,u2qu1,u2eu2n−1/2, 2.46with polynomial q. The inequality Ku,v;zpu1/2v−1/2e−Rzv 2.47implies that there exists M02, such that for all z with RzM0 the norm of the integral operator K in the Banach space H see 1.10satisfies the inequality K12 , 2.48and so there exists the inverse operator I−K−1. But the problem is that the bound for rn4above does not allow us to conclude that rn4H recall that we fixed u2 and consider rn4as a function of u1. This difficulty can be easily overcome if we consider a new function M ˜ 2,nz1,u1;z2,u2= M2,nz1,u1;z2,u2− rn 4z1,u1;z2,u2. Then 2.46takes the form M ˜ 2,nz1,u1;z2,u2= 0dvKu1,v;z1M ˜ 2,n 1z1,v;z2,u2+ Vz1,u1;z2,u2+ Krn 4z1,u1;z2,u2+ On−1/2, 2.49and 2.47yields Krn 4z1,u1;z2,u2Cun−1/2. Thus we can apply the I−K−1 to 2.49and obtain that for any z :RzM0 there exists the limit M2z1,u1;z2,u2ª 0I − K−1u1,v;z1Vz1,v;z2,u2dv. 2.50But according to Lemma 1 M2,nz1 ,u1 ; z2 ,u2is an analytic function bounded uniformly in each compact in the right half plane of C. Hence, taking any bounded domain U which contains some z: RzM0, for any fixed u1 ,u2 we can choose a subsequence M2,nkz1 ,u1 ; z2 ,u2which converges uniformly in z1U to some analytic in U function. But since for z: RzM0 for any convergent subsequence there exists a unique limit of M2,nkz1 ,u1 ; z2 ,u2, defined by 2.50, on the basis of the uniqueness theorem we conclude that for any zU there exists a limit of M2,nz1 ,u1 ; z2 ,u2and this limit for RzM0 is defined by 2.50. Hence we have proved 1.17for m=2. For arbitrary m we have instead of 2.41, Mm,nªnm/2+1/2Ee'−u1G11z1j=2 m n−1D1zj,uj+ f 'n 1zj,uj+ On−1/2= nm/2+1/2Ee'−u1G11z1j=2 m f 'n 1zj,uj+j=2 m nm−1/2Ee'−u1G11z1D1zj,ujij f 'n 1zi,ui+ On−1/2!T1 +j=2 m T2j + On−1/2. 2.51023523-15 CLT for eigenvalue statistics of random graphs J.

Then, similarly to 2.43, we write T1 from the right hand side of 2.51as T1 = 0dvKnu1,v;z1Mm,nz1,v; . . . ;zm,um+ rn 3z1,u1; . . . ;zm,um+ On−1/2qu1, . . . ,um, 2.52where rn3admits the bound 2.44. Since fn1does not depend on a1jj=2 n we can average with respect to these variables and, using 2.37write T2j in the form T2j = EE1e−u1G11z1D1zj,uj− E1e−u1G11z1E1D1zj,uj- i=2,ij m f 'n 1zj,uj= EVnz1,u1;zj,ujEi=2,ij m f 'n 1zj,uj+ EV ' nz1,u1;zj,uji=2,ij m f 'n 1zj,uj. 2.53Using the Schwartz inequality and Lemma 1 and Lemma 2, it is easy to obtain that the last term in the right hand side of 2.53is On−1/2. Hence, 2.51-2.53yield Mm,nz1,u1; . . . ;zm,um= 0dvKnu1,v;z1Mm,nz1,v; . . . ;zm,um+j=1 m EVnz1,u1;zj,ujMm−2,nz2,v2; . . . ;zj−1,uj−1;zj+1,uj+1, . . . ;zm,um+ On−1/2q1u1, . . . ,umeu2 + ¯+ euj, 2.54Then, using once more the argument, which we applied to 2.50, we can prove 1.17first for Rz2 and then extend it to the whole right half plane of C. Proof of Theorem 4: We prove Theorem 4 in two steps: first for polynomial and then extend the statement to any real valued functions , satisfying conditions of the theorem. For polynomial we replace in Theorem 3 the product of traces of resolvent of A with different zj see 1.19by the product of traces of 1A, . . . ,pAwith 1 , . . . ,m being some fixed polynomials. More precisely, we consider cf. 1.19Mp,n1, . . . ,mªn−m/2ETr '1A¯Tr 'mA= Ej=1 m n−1/2N' njand prove that for any m and any fixed polynomial 1 , . . . ,m there exists the limit lim n→Mm,n1, . . . ,m= Mm1, . . . ,m2.55and Mm1, . . . ,m=j=2 m M21,jMm−22, . . . ,j−1,j+1, . . . ,m. 2.56Then taking 1=¯=m=P we obtain that there exist the limits of all moments of n−1/2N' nPand these moments are expressed in terms of the second moment by the same way as for the Gaussian random variable. Recall that Theorem 3 imply that the 2.55and 2.56are valid for zj=i−zj−1. We will replace zj by the polynomial j in 2.55and 2.56step by step, starting from the last one zm. 023523-16 M.

To this end we prove by induction with respect to the polynomial degree k that if we replace zmby a polynomial Pkof degree not exceeding k, then 2.55and 2.56are valid. For k=0,1 N' nPk=0 recall that Ajj=0, so 2.55and 2.56are trivial. Let us assume that we know 2.55and 2.56for m=Plwith lk−1 and prove that they are valid for l=k. Consider m= ,zm,k= − zmki− zm−1 = − − ikzmzm k i− zm−1 +l=1 k Ck l i− zml−1zm k−l. 2.57By the above representation and the induction assumption 2.55and 2.56are valid for m=, zm,kwith any zm. Moreover, if we use the inequalities En−1/2N' nPkmCm,k, Pk= k, k,m N, En−1/2N' nkmCm,k/Rz, k= ki− z−1, 2.58combined with the Hölder inequality, Mm,n1, . . . ,mj=1 m E1/mn−1/2N' njm, then, since Pk−; zm,k=−ik+1 , we obtain Mm,n1, . . . ,Pk− Mm,n1, . . . ,. ;zm,k= Mm,n1, . . . ,k+1 C Rzm1/m , 2.59where C does not depend on n and zm. We will prove 2.58later. Now let us use a simple proposition. Proposition 3: Let the sequence of the functions unn=1 converges point-wise to the function uz, as n→, in the domain RC, and for any fixed n un→un , as R→, so that un− un C0/R, 0. 2.60Then there exist the limits lim n→un = lim R→u. 2.61Proof: Take any 0 and such that C0 /R/4. Moreover, choose N such that un−u/4 for any nN. Then for any n,nN, un − unun − un+ un− un+ un− u+ un− u. Hence, there exists u=limn→un . In addition, for any and any 0 one can choose N, such that uN−u/2 and uN −u/2. Then u− uu− uN+ uN− uN + uN − u+ C0/R. Thus, there exists the second limit in 2.61and it coincides with u. Now if for fixed z1 , . . . , zm−1 we consider the functions unzm=Mm,n1 , . . . ,. ; zm,k, then 2.57gives the pointwise convergence of unzmand 2.59coincides with 2.60of Proposition 3 with un =Mk,n1 , . . . ,Pk. Applying the proposition we obtain that 2.55and 2.56are valid if we replace the last function m by any polynomial of degree k. 023523-17 CLT for eigenvalue statistics of random graphs J. Math.

Repeating the above procedure we replace step by step all 1 , . . .m−1 by polynomials of any fixed degree. As it was mentioned about this implies that for any polynomial P n−1/2N' nPconverges in distribution to a Gaussian random variable with zero mean and the variance from 2.62. Hence, by the standard argument we conclude that uniformly in x varying in any compact of R, Eeixn−1/2N ' nP= e−x2/2VP, VP= lim n→Varn−1/2NnP. 2.62To finish the proof of CLT for polynomials we are left to prove 2.58. It is done in the further proof of Theorem 4. To extend CLT to a wider class of functions we use the following. Proposition 4: Let lnl=1 n be a triangular array of random variables, Nn=l=1 n lnbe its linear statistics, corresponding to a test function :R→R, and Vn= Varn−1/2Nnbe the variance of Nn. Assume that (a) there exists a vector space L endowed with a norm ¯and such that Vn is defined on L and admits the bound VnC2, ∀ L, 2.63where C does not depend on n; (b) there exists a dense linear manifold L1L . such that the CLT is valid forNn, L1, i.e., if Znx= Eeixn−1/2N ' nis the characteristic function of n−1/2N' n, then there exists a continuous quadratic functional V:L1→R+, such that we have uniformly in x, varying on any compact interval lim n→Znx= e−x2V/2, ∀ L1. 2.64Then V admits a continuous extension to L and CLT is valid for all Nn, L. Proof: Let kbe a sequence of elements of L1 converging to L. We have then in view of the inequality eia−eiba−b, the linearity of N' nin , the Schwarz inequality, and 2.63, Znx− Znx=kxEn−1/2N' n− n−1/2N' nkxVar1/2n−1/2Nn− kCx− k. Now, passing first to the limit n→and then k→, we obtain the assertion. Let us show now that hypotheses aand bof Proposition 4 are fulfilled in some vector space. We fix some c0 and consider the vector space L of functions , such that ,,L2R,cosh−2csee 1.22. Denote 2 = 2cosh−2cd+ 2cosh−2cd+ 2cosh−2cd. It is evident that the space of all polynomials Lis dense subspace in L with respect to the norm . . Moreover, 2.62proves b. Hence we are left to check assumption aof Proposition 4. It is easy to see that if L then f=cosh−1cL2Rand also f, fL2Rand 023523-18 M. Shcherbina and B. Tirozzi J. Math. Phys. 51, 023523 2010Downloaded 16 Apr 2011 to 158.250.33.122.

Note that to prove 2.65it suffices to consider m=1, but we need other m to prove 2.58. Write TrfAecA − fA1ecA1= df ˆ Trei+cA − ei+cA1, where f ˆ is the Fourier transform of f. Then the Duhamel formula yields Trei+cA − ei+cA1= 01 dti+ cTreti+cAA − A1ei+cA11−t= 01 dti+ cj=1 n eti+cAj1ei+cA11−ta1je2tcAe1,e11/2e2cA11−ta1,a11/2. Here we used that Treti+cAA − A1ei+cA11−t=j,k eti+cAj1a1kei+cA11−tkj +j,k eti+cAjkak1ei+cA11−t1j . The first some gives j=1 n eti+cAe1jei+cA11−ta1j, where e1=1,0, . . . ,0and the vector a1is defined in 2.8. The second sum can be estimated similarly, since relations Ai1 1=A1i 1=0 i =1, . . . ,nimply ei+cA11−t1i=0 i=2, . . . ,n. Then the Schwarz inequality yields Varn−1/2 Tr fAecAC2f ˆ + cd2E1/2e2tcAe1,e12E1/2e21−tcA1a1,a12. 2.67Using the Schwarz inequality once more and then the symmetry of the problem, we obtain Ee2tcAe1,e12Ee4tcAe1,e1= ETr e4tcA. Similarly, using the Schwarz inequality and then the independence A1of a1, we can average with respect to a1to obtain Ee21−tcA1a1,a12Ee41−tcA1a1,a1a1,a1CEn−1 Tr e41−tcA1+ CE1/2n−1 Tr e81−tcA1. Since all entries of A and A1and A−A1are positive, we have for any t ETr e41−tcA1ETr e41−tcAETr e4cA.
