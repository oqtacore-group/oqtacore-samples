Introduction Let {Xn, n ? 1} be a random variable sequence defined on a fixed probability space ?,F, Pand Sn ni1 Xi for each n ? 1. Let n and m be positive integers. Write Fmn ?Xi, n ? i ? m. Given ?-algebras B, R in F, let ?B,Rsup A?B,B?R,P A>0|PB | A? PB|. 1.1Define the ?-mixing coefficients by ?nsup k?1 ?Fk1 ,F?kn, n? 0. 1.2Definition 1.1. A random variable sequence {Xn, n ? 1} is said to be a ?-mixing random variable sequence if ?nv 0 as n > ?. The concept of ?-mixing random variables was introduced by Dobrushin 1and many applications have been found. See, for example, Dobrushin 1, Utev 2, and Chen 3

When these are compared with the corresponding results of independent random variable sequences, there still remains much to be desired. The main purpose of this paper is to study the maximal inequality for ?-mixing sequences, by which we can get theH?ajek-R?enyi-type inequality, strong law of large numbers, strong growth rate, and the integrability of supremum for ?-mixing sequences. Throughout the paper, C denotes a positive constant which may be different in various places. The main results of this paper depend on the following lemmas. Lemma 1.2 see Lu and Lin 12. Let {Xn, n ? 1} be a sequence of ?-mixing random variables. Let X ? LpFk1 , Y ? LqF?kn, p ? 1, q ? 1, and 1/p 1/q 1. Then |EXY ? EXEY| ? 2?n1/pE|X|p1/pE|Y|q1/q. 1.3Lemma 1.3 see Shao 10. Let {Xn, n ? 1} be a ?-mixing sequence. Put Tanan ia1 Xi. Suppose that there exists an array {Ca,n} of positive numbers such that ET2 a n? Ca,n for every a ? 0, n ? 1. 1.4Then for every q ? 2, there exists a constant C depending only on q and ?-such that Emax 1?j?nTajq? CCq/2 a,n Emax a1?i?an|Xi|q1.5for every a ? 0 and n ? 1. Lemma 1.4 see Hu et al. 13. Let b1, b2, . . . be a nondecreasing unbounded sequence of positive numbers and let ?1, ?2, . . . be nonnegative numbers. Let r and C be fixed positive numbers. Assume that for each n ? 1, Emax 1?l?n|Sl|r ? C nl1?l, 1.6?l1 ?l brl < ?, 1.7then lim n>?Sn bn 0 a.s., 1.8and with the growth rate Sn bn O?n bna.s., 1.9

Let b1, b2, . . . be a nondecreasing unbounded sequence of positive numbers and let ?1, ?2, . . . be nonnegative numbers. Denote ?k ?1 ?2 - - - ?k for k ? 1. Let r be a fixed positive number satisfying 1.6. If ?l1?l1 brl ? 1 brl1< ?, 1.12?n brnis bounded, 1.13then 1.8-1.11hold. 2. Maximal Inequality for ?-Mixing Sequences Theorem 2.1. Let {Xn, n ? 1} be a sequence of ?-mixing random variables satisfying ?n1 ?1/2n< ?. Assume that EXn 0 and EX2n< ? for each n ? 1. Then there exists a constant C depending only on ?-such that for any n ? 1 and a ? 0 Eania1Xi2 ? C ania1EX2i , 2.1E??max 1?j?naj ia1Xi2?? ? C ania1EX2i . 2.2

By Lemma 1.2 for p q 2, we can see that Eania1Xi2 ania1EX2i 2 a1?i<j?anEXiXj? ania1EX2i 4 a1?i<j?an?1/2j ? iEX2i 1/2EX2j 1/2 ? ania1EX2i 2n?1k1 an?k ia1 ?1/2kEX2i EX2ki? 1 4 ?k1 ?1/2kania1EX2i ? C ania1EX2i , 2.5which implies 2.1. By 2.1and Lemma 1.3 take q 2, we can get E??max 1?j?naj ia1Xi2?? ? Cania1EX2i Emax a1?i?anX2i ? C ania1EX2i . 2.6The proof is completed. 3. Ha? jek-Re?nyi-Type Inequality for ?-Mixing Sequences In this section, we will give the H?ajek-R?enyi-type inequality for ?-mixing sequences, which can be applied to obtain the strong law of large numbers and the integrability of supremum. Theorem 3.1. Let {Xn, n ? 1} be a sequence of ?-mixing random variables satisfying ?n1 ?1/2n< ? and let {bn, n ? 1} be a nondecreasing sequence of positive numbers. Then for

Without loss of generality, we assume that bn ? 1 for all n ? 1. Let ? v2. For i ? 0, define Ai 1 ? k ? n : ?i ? bk < ?i1. 3.2For Ai/?, we let vimax{k : k ? Ai} and tn be the index of the last nonempty set Ai. Obviously, AiAj ? if i/j andtn i0 Ai {1, 2, . . . , n}. It is easily seen that ?i ? bk ? bvi< ?i1 if k ? Ai and {Xn?EXn, n ? 1} is also a sequence of ?-mixing random variables. By Markov's inequality and 2.4, we have P?? ?max 1?k?n1 bk kj1Xj ? EXj? ??? ? P?? ? max 0?i?tn,Ai/? max k?Ai1 bk kj1Xj ?

Therefore, tni0,Ai/?,vi?j 1 ?2i < ?ii0 1 ?2i 1 1 ? 1/?2 1 ?2i0 < ?2 1 ? 1/?2 1 b2j 4 b2j . 3.4Thus, 3.1follows from 3.3and 3.4immediately.

Let {Xn, n ? 1} be a sequence of ?-mixing random variables satisfying ?n1 ?1/2n< ? and let {bn, n ? 1} be a nondecreasing sequence of positive numbers. Then for any ? > 0 and any positive integers m < n, P??max m?k?n1 bk kj1Xj ? EXj? ??? ? 4C ?2 ?? mj1 VarXjb2m 4 njm1VarXjb2j ??, 3.5where C is defined in 3.1. Proof. Observe that max m?k?n1 bk kj1Xj ? EXj? 1 bm mj1Xj ? EXjmax m1?k?n1 bk kjm1Xj ? EXj, 3.6thus P??max m?k?n1 bk kj1Xj ? EXj? ??? ? P??1 bm mj1Xj ? EXj? ?2??P?? max m1?k?n1 bk kjm1Xj ? EXj? ?2???

Noting that max m1?k?n1 bk kjm1Xj ? EXjmax 1?k?n?m1 bmk kj1Xmj ? EXmj, 3.9thus, by Theorem 3.1, we get II ? 4C ?/22 n?m j1 VarXmjb2mj 16C ?2 njm1VarXjb2j . 3.10Therefore, the desired result 3.5follows from 3.7-3.10immediately.

Let {Xn, n ? 1} be a sequence of ?-mixing random variables satisfying ?n1 ?1/2n< ? and let {bn, n ? 1} be a nondecreasing sequence of positive numbers. Denote Tn ni1Xi ? EXifor n ? 1. Assume that ?j1 VarXjb2j < ?, 3.11then for any r ? 0, 2, Esup n?1Tn bnr? 1 4Cr 2 ? r ?j1 VarXjb2j < ?, 3.12where C is defined in 3.1. Furthermore, if limn>?bn ?, then lim n>? 1 bn nj1Xj ? EXj0 a.s. 3.13Proof. By the continuity of probability and Theorem 3.1, we get Esup n?1Tn bnr?0 Psup n?1Tn bnr > tdt 10Psup n?1Tn bnr > tdt ?1 Psup n?1Tn bnr > tdt ? 1 ?1 Psup n?1Tn bn> t1/rdt ? 1 ?1 lim N>?Pmax 1?n?NTn bn> t1/rdt ? 1 4C ?j1 VarXjb2j ?1 t?2/rdt 1 4Cr 2 ? r ?j1 VarXjb2j < ?. 3.14Observe that P?nmTn bn> ?P?Nmmax m?n?NTn bn> ?lim N>?Pmax m?n?NTn bn> ?. 3.15
8 Journal of Inequalities and Applications By Theorem 3.2, we have that Pmax m?n?NTn bn> ?? 4C ?2 ?? mj1 VarXjb2m 4 Njm1VarXjb2j ??. 3.16Hence, by 3.11and Kronecker's Lemma, it follows that lim m>?P?nmTn bn> ?0, ?? > 0, 3.17which is equivalent to lim n>? 1 bn nj1Xj ? EXj0 a.s. 3.18So the desired results are proved. 4. Strong Law of Large Numbers and Growth Rate for ?-Mixing Sequences Theorem 4.1. Let {Xn, n ? 1} be a sequence of mean zero ?-mixing random variables satisfying ?n1 ?1/2n< ? and let {bn, n ? 1} be a nondecreasing unbounded sequence of positive numbers.

By 2.4in Theorem 2.1, we have Emax 1?k?n|Sk|2? C ni1EX2i nk1?k. 4.7It follows by 4.1that ?n1 ?n b2n C ?n1EX2n b2n < ?. 4.8Thus, 4.2-4.6follow from4.7, 4.8, and Lemma 1.4 immediately.We complete the proof of the theorem. Theorem 4.2. Let {Xn, n ? 1} be a sequence of ?-mixing random variables with?n1 ?1/2n< ?. 1 ? p < 2. Denote Qn max1?k?nEX2k for n ? 1 and Q0 0. Assume that ?n1 Qn n2/p < ?, 4.9then lim n>? 1 n1/p ni1 Xi ?

Assume that EXn 0, bn n1/p, and ?n nl1 ?l, n ? 1. By 2.4in Theorem 2.1, we can see that E??max 1?k?nki1Xi2?? ? C ni1EX2i ? CnQn nk1?k. 4.17It is a simple fact that ?k ? 0 for all k ? 1. It follows by 4.9that ?l1 ?l1 b2l ? 1 b2l1C ?l1 lQl1 l2/p ? 1 l 12/p? 2Cp ?l1 Ql l2/p < ?. 4.18
Journal of Inequalities and Applications 11 That is to say 1.12holds. By Remark 2.1 in Fazekas and Klesov 14, 1.12implies 1.13. By Lemma 1.5, we can obtain 4.10-4.15immetiately. By 4.14, it follows that Esup l?1 Sl l1/pr?0 Psup l?1 Sl l1/pr > tdt ? 1 ?1 Psup l?1 Sl l1/p> t1/rdt ? 1 Esup l?1 Sl l1/p2?1 t?2/rdt ? 1 4r 2 ? r ?l1 ?l l2/p < ?. 4.19The proof is completed. Remark 4.3. By using the maximal inequality, we get the H?ajek-R?enyi-type inequality, the strong law of large numbers and the strong growth rate for ?-mixing sequences. In addition, we get some new bounds of probability inequalities for ?-mixing sequences, such as 3.1, 3.5, 3.12, 4.5-4.6, and 4.13-4.16.
