The main idea is to generalize to martingales some ideas of E. Gine and J. Zinn [Ann. Prob. 12, 929-989 (1984)]. We consider two examples: An extension of a theorem of R. Dudley from i.i.d, to a certain type of Markov chain, and a uniform CLT for the "baker's transformation." KEY WORDS: Martingales; empirical central limit theorems; Markov chains; baker's transformation; continuous Gaussian processes. 1. INTRODUCTION AND MAIN RESULTS Let (W, d) be a metric space where d is a metric on a set W. Let (~)i~>0 be an increasing sequence of ~r fields on a probability space (12, J, P). For each w~ W we assume that {X~(w), f}i~>l is a sequence of martingale differences. Before we state our main theorem we need some notations (e is a positive number): D(e, W, d) --max{m: There exists a subset {wl,..., win) -W that satisfiesd (wi, wj) ~> e for i ~ j} (1.1) [ W, ~, d] = { )ff ~_ W: d(hi, hi)>~e, hi v~ hj~ g, and infh~ g d(w, h) <~ ~ for each w ~ W} (1.2) t Department of Statistics & Probability, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan 48824. 271 0894-9840/89/0700-0271506.00/0 9 1989 Plenum Publishing Corporation 860/2/3-1 
272 Levental Given Yg~___ W and we W we denote by w, a point in ~ for which d(w, w,)=infh~e d(w, h). For every YeL2(P) we put (k3) Our main theorem is as follows: Theorem 1. Assume that -1 ~< X~(w) ~< 1 for each w e W, i >/1. Suppose the following conditions hold: (a) ~ [log D(u, W, d)]V2du is finite; and (b) There exist ~>0, Co>0 such that for each eo>~e>0 there are constants H(e), C(~)>0 such that for a n2 -_ C(~)n-m, n = 1, 2 .... there is e [ W, an, d] such that (i) P( sup ~ a2i[Yi(s)-Yi(t)]/d2(s, t)<nH(O)~ l \s,t~,~'~n l ~i<<.n and \w~W l~i~n Then for every e > 0 there is 6 > 0 such that limsupP*( sup ~ Xi(s)-Xi(t)/nV2>e)<<.e n \d(s,t)~6 l~i~n All the examples in this paper deal with martingale differences that are stationary. So to fix notions for the rest of the paper we take the following setup: Let ~ be a a field on a set S. We choose (f2 = S z, J-= OC t, P) as our basic probability space. We denote by T the left shift on f2 and assume throughout that P is invariant under T, i.e., pT-I= P, and that T is ergodic. We denote by X . . . . . X_l, Xo, X1,... the coordinate maps on s From our assumptions it follows that {Xe} g~, is a strictly stationary and ergodic process. Next we define for each i e Z a a algebra Mg = a(Xj: j <% i) and He={f:s feM e and feL2(s We also denote a2(f)= E(f2IM ~), feL2(s and HoOH_I={feHo: E(f-g)=O for each geH_l}. Finally we put p(f, g)= [E(f-g)2]l/2, f, gcL2(s From our setup it follows that for every fe HoOH_I, (f(Te(X)), Me) is a stationary martingale-difference sequence. As a result we get by Ref. 1 that ~(~,o<e<~nf[Te(X)]/nl/2)~N(O,E[f2]). Our goal here is to find sufficient conditions for the existence of a uniform central limit theorem (UCLT). This essentially means showing that ~(S~o<~g<~nf[Ti(X)]/(nm): fs ~-)~ s fe~), where the processes that are involved here are indexed by ~ and are considered as random elements in the space of the 
Uniform CLT 273 bounded real functions on if, taken with the supremum norm. (G(f): f~ff) is a Gaussian process whose sample paths are a.s. uniformly continuous with respect to p, which is the natural metric to take here. When we reformulate Theorem 1 in our setup we get the following theorem: Theorem 2. Assume that ~-HoQH_I and -l~<f~<l for each fs ~. Let d be a metric on ~. Suppose the following conditions hold: (a) ~1 [log D(u, ~, d)] m du is finite, and (b) there exist z > 0, eo > 0 such that for each eo~>e>0 there are constants H(e), C(e)>O such that for aZn = C(e)n 1/2, n = 1, 2,... there is ~ ~ I-~-, an, d] such that (i) P( sup ~ tr2[(f-g)Ti]/d2(f,g)<nH(e))~O \f,g~.~n l <~i<~n and k,/"e,~v l~<i~n Then for every e > O there is 6 > 0 such that limsupP*( sup ~ (f-g)[Ti(X)] /nl/2>~e)<~e n \d(f,g)<~6 l~<i~<n If in addition to (a) and (b), (~, d) is a compact metric space and 0<p(f g)<~d(f g), f# ge~ then the UCLT holds. Theorem 2 can be considered as a generalization of the sufficient part of Theorem 3.1 in Ref. 3. To specialize our work to their framework we assume that P = (Po) z for some P0, a probability measure on S (in other words the X~ are i.i.d.) and that all the functions in ~-depend on the Xl coordinate only and E(f(X1))=O. In that case a2[(f-g)T~]=p2(f g) and so condition (b)(i) is trivial while conditions (a) and (b)(ii) are essentially the theorem of Gine and Zinn. In Section 2 we will prove Theorem 2. The philosophy of the proof is simple. First we establish an exponential inequality, and then, by using a stopping time, we can do the usual chaining argument. All that remains to do is to check that the stopping time does not restrict us too much and that is done by condition (b)(i). Since we do not use the stationary in order to establish the tightness part of the theorem, our proof of Theorem 2 can also be considered as a proof for Theorem 1. In Section 3 we will give an application of Theorem 2 to Markov chains. More specifically Theorem 3 is a generalization of Theorem 6.2.1 in Ref. 2 to a certain type of Markov chain. In Section 4 we will present another two examples for which we are able to verify the conditions of Theorem 2. The first example in the section 
274 Levental is an empricial CLT for the "baker transformation," while the second example deals with the case of the sup metric. 2. THE PROOF OF THEOREM 2 We will begin with the following remark on an inequality of Johnson, Schectman and Zinn, t6) Proposition 3.1. This inequality is a martingale version of Prokhorov "arcsinh" inequality. Recall that arcsinh(x)= log[x+ (1 +x2) 1/2] for x~. Lemma 1. Let (d,.)l~<i_< . be a martingale difference with respect to increasing tr algebras (4)o~i_<,, i.e., E(dil 4_ l) = 0, i=1 ..... n. Suppose that Ildillo~ ~<M for a constant M< 0% i= 1 ..... n. Let t<<.n be a stopping time relative to the (4) that satisfies [[Z~ ~ i<, E(d~[ 4-~)11 ~ ~< L for a constant L. Then for each e/> 0 P( ~ <~<< t di > ~) <~ 2 exp{ -(~/2M) " arcsinh(M ~ [2L ]-~) } Proof Let us use the notation a~=E(d~14_0, i= 1 ..... n. First step: We assume t-n. Remark. In this case the difference between our inequality and Proposition3.1 in Johnson, Schectman, and Zinn (JSZ) (6) is that here 11527= 1 a~tl oo ~< L is assumed while according to the JSZ inequality we need Z~'=a I]a~][~ ~<L. However, essentially all that is needed is to follow the proof of JSZ and while doing so to use the fact that L--~21~k-~ a~ is ~-z measurable, 2 ~< k ~< n. And that is what we will do. Since e x-x-1 ~< 2(cosh x-1 ) ~< x sinh x for every x ~ ~ and (sinh x)/x is increasing in ixl, we have for all fi>0 and for a fixed iE {1,..., n} E(e '~'~'-1 [4_ ~) <~ E(6d~sinh 6d~[4 1) (a 2 6 sinh 6M)/M We also need the inequality y~<exp(y-1) for y~ R. Now we compute as follows: Eexp 6 ~ di =Eexp 6 ~ t l<~i<~n--I ~< E exp (6 l <~i<~n--I ~< E exp (6 l<~i<~n--1 dl) E(e~a"14,-l) di) exp [ E( e "~a" I ~n -l ) -1 ] d~) exp[aZ(f/M) sinh 6M] 
Uniform CLT 275 Obviously the last expression is smaller than Eexp(~l<~g~<~n_ldei)x pI(L-l<~i~<~n_lff])( (~/M)sinhc~M] (2.1) Since L-~21~i~n_l~r~ is ~-2 measurable, we can repeat the above argument on (2.1) (this time conditioning on ~-2). After iterating n times we get exp( . s nh i=l By using the usual argument of Markov's inequality in exponential form we will get the desired result. For e > 0 and ~ > 0 we have P(i~l di>/e)<~EIexpf'(l~i-<~.~ndi-e)l ~< exp 6[(L/M) sinh ~M-e] Putting 6 = (l/M)arcsinh(Me/2L) will lead to P (i~=, di>~e ) <~e xp[-(e/2M) arcsinh(Me/2L)] Application of this inequality to {-d i} will give the same bound for P(Y.7= t di ~< -e) and we are done with the first step. Second step: The general case. Put e~=dk, l{k.<t}, k=l,...,n It is easy to check that (ek)~.<k.<n satisfies the condition of the first step: E(eil ~/_ ~) = O, I[e~ll o~ ~< Ildkll ~ ~<M and E(e]l~"~/-1)= E o-,.2~L a.s. i=1 l <.i<~t So we use the first step for {ek} and we get P i~1 ei > e ~< 2 exp[-(e/2M) arcsinh(Me/2L)] But ~2~=1 ei--=Y'~l<~i<~t di and we are done. 
276 Levental Proof of Theorem 2. e that satisfies % ~> e > 0 will be fixed throughout the proof. For f, g ~ ~ we are in a position to use Lemma 1 with M = 2. First we define a stopping time tn, n >~ 1: t,=n Amax ~0~<k: sup ~ az((f-g)Ti)/d2(f, g)<nH(e)~ (2.2) f,g~n l~i<~k ) Next we observe that for each m > 0 x/K(m) <<a. rcsinh(x), 0 ~< x ~< m (2.3) where K(m)=m/arcsinh(m). To see (2.3) we observe that arcsinh(0)=0 and arcsinh(x) is increasing and concave for x/> 0. We fix m(~)> 0 such that [m(e) C(~)]-1 >/H(a). Our goal is to prove the following: If a ] <~ d2(f g)/~l, f, g ~ thenP(l<~<~to(f-g)[Ti(X)] /na/2>/q) (2.4) ~< 2 exp{ -[r/2/Zd2(f, g)] C(e) arcsinh[m(e)] } To see (2.4) we use Lemma 1 with the identifications L := [re(e) C(~)] -1 nde(f, g) and e := qn t/2 We get for f, g E ~: P( ~ (f-g)[Ti(X)] /nm>~rl) l~i<~tn ~< 2 exp{ -07nU2/4) arcsinh[qnl/2m(e) C(e)/ndZ(f, g)] } Now we observe that aZ<~dZ(f,g)/rl, which can be rewritten as qnl/Zm(a) C(~)/ndZ(f, g)<<. m(e), implies by (2.3) that qnl/2m(~) C(a)/K(m) nd2(f, g) <<a. rcsinh[qnl/2m(a) C(~)/ndZ(f, g) ] So we conclude: If a] <<. d2(f, g)/rl then 2 exp{ -(qnm/4) arcsinh[rlnmm(~) C(e)/nd2(f, g)] } ~< 2 exp{ -(qnl/2/4)[qnmm(e) C(e)/K(m) nd2(f, g)] } = 2 exp{ -[q2/2d2(f, g)] C(e) arcsinh[m(e)] } We have verified (2.4). Inequality (2.4) and condition (a) of Theorem 2 are the main tools in proving the following claim. 
Uniform CLT 277 Claim 1. For every ~0/> ~ > 0 there exists 6 > 0 such that for n large enough e (d(~U~<~6 l<~i<~t. (f --g)[Zi(X)] /n112>~5"~) ~c~ l <~i<~tn In the proof of Claim 1 we will follow the chaining argument that appears in Ref. 7, pp. 161-162, with some minor modifications that are needed in our situation. We choose 6=max a~>O: {21og[D2(u,~,d)/u]}l/2du<~ez/12Canda<~e/3 where C := {C(e) arcsinh[m(e)] } -1/2 We put H(u)= {2 log[D2(u, ~, d)/u]} 1/2, 6i=3k-ian, and ~=C6~H(6~+1), i=0 ..... k, where k is an integer that satisfies 6<3ka~<36. Next we construct To ~ T1---... -Tk = ~. We do it inductively in the following way: After constructing T~ we choose Ti_l c_ Ti that satisfies 6i-1< d(fi, fj), fi, fj~Ti 1, and d(Ti 1,f)<~6i_1, feTi. We observe the following two facts: ae<d(Ti_~,f)<<.6i ~,f ~T,\Te_I (2.5) and Ni ~< D(6i, ~, d) (2.6) where Ni is the number of elements in T~. We have the following estimate: \ f ~ t<~i<~nt \ fkETk <~i<~tn \ (f0, g0) ~ q/l<~i<~nt = (I) + (II) +(III) (2.7) 
278 Levental where in (II) fo9 To corresponds to fk9 Tk in the following way: We build inductively the sequence (fz)o ~i~ k starting with k to ensure that fi 9 T; and d(f,.+ ~, Ti) = d(f,-+l, f~). In (III) we have q/= { ()co, go) 9 To x To: there exist f, g 9 ~ such that d(f, g) ~< 6 and fo, go corresponds to fg,, g~e,, respectively } We first deal with (II): Since ~o~i.<k-1 rh~<Te as follows from the definition of 6 (see Ref. 7), we bound (II) from above by P(max I ~ ( f i -f , -1 ) [ T J ( X ) ] /nl/2>~rh-l) (2.8) i=1 \ fii'~Tl <~j<~t n Next we observe that d2(fi, f,-_ ~) /rh_ l >~ 62/th_ , >--6 2/qk-1 = a2/[ 3Ca,,H(a.) ] >~ anz (2.9) where the last inequality is for n large enough as follows from the fact that an~0 and anH(a.)~f H(u)du ~ O <~ u <~ an Using (2.9) we can apply (2.4) to bound (2.8) from above. In the next calculation we also make use of (2.5) and (2.6). We bound (2.8) from above by k N,.2 exp-{q2_ 1/[2C2d2(f~, fg_ 1)] } i=1 k <~ ~ D(a,, ~, d)2 exp-It/2 1/(2C262_ 1)] ~<g i=l where in the last inequality we used 6 ~< e/3 and the sum of geometric series. Next we deal with (III): We have for n large enough: 36~< d(fo, go) <~ 126, (fo, go) 9 q/. The last inequality since d(fo, go) <-d(f, g) + d(f.,e., f) + d(gae., g) + d(g.,e. = gk, go) + d(f.. = fk, fo) <~ 6 + 2a. + 2~/k=l 6i_ 1 ~ 126, since an ~ 0. The number of pairs in og ~< N g ~< D2(6o, ~, d)<<.D2(6, ~, d). For (fo, go)9 we have for n large enough dE(f0, go)/Ze>~962/ze>>.a], so we will be able to use (2.4) in the next calculation. We bound (III) above with D2(6, ~-, d)2 exp[-(ze)2/(2C214462)] = 26 exp{(6-E/Z)[H(6)262 -(ve)2/(C144)] } ~< 26 <-..e 
Uniform CLT 279 The last two steps follow from 6H(6)<~ ~o<~u<~6 H(u)du and the definition of 6. We have finished the proof of Claim 1. [] Now we proceed as follows: From (b)(i) we get that P(tn < n)~ 0 as n ~ ~. This fact together with (b)(ii) gives For every eo >/e > 0 there exists 3 > 0 such that limsupP*( sup ~ (f-g)[Ti(X)]/nX/2>~5ze)<~2~ (2.10) n \d(f,g)<~6 l<~i<~n So we proved the following: For every e > 0 there is 3 > 0 such that limsupP*( sup ,~. (f-g)[T'(X)/]n '/'>~e)<~ {2.11) \d(f,g)<~5 ~i<~n If we assume thar (~, d) is compact and that p ~< d, then it follows that (~, p) is compact and that d is uniformly continuous w.r.t.p. So we get that (2.11) is satisfied with p instead of d. This and the fact that (~-, p) is totally bounded are known to be sufficient for UCLT; see for example Ref. 7, Theorem21, p. 157 (actually the setup there is for i.i.d, while we are dealing with the stationary case, but there is no use of independence in the proof that is given there). That completes the proof of Theorem 2. 3. AN APPLICATION TO MARKOV CHAINS Let Xo, X1, )(2 .... be a strictly stationary and ergodic Markov chain taking values in a measure space (S, ~) with transition mechanism P(x, dy). Let ~ denote the law of Xi. We assume that there is a probability measure on S, denoted by #, and 0 < s < t such that the following two properties hold: P(x, dy)=P(x, y)#(dy), x, yeS (3.1) and O<s<.P(x, y)<~ t< ~, x, yeS (3.2) We observe that t >>. ~(A)/#(A)/> s, A e ~: From (3.1) and (3.2) it follows that t >>. P(x, A)/#(A)>t s and then we use E~ P(x, A)= ~(A), which follows from the stationarity. For each 1 ~< p ~< ~, we define, as usual, an operator P on Lp(S, ~r ~) by P(g)(x) = ~s g(y) P(x, dy), g e Lp(S) (3.3) 
280 Levental From IPg(x)l ~ 5 I g(y)[ P(x, y) #(dy) <~ ~ I g(Y)I (t/s) cr : (t/s)II gila we get Ilpglloo<<.(t/s)llglla, g~LI(S ) (3.4) Now put Jg, = {fe Lp(S): E~(f) = 0}. From the ergodicity it follows that I-P is one to one on Jgp. Also, it is obvious that (I-P)JCp~_Jl/lp. Actually Jlp= (I-P)J~p: For p= 1 we observe that p2 is compact as an operator on J/g1, as follows from the classical result that P is compact on Jg2 (see Ref. 8, Example 2, p. 277) together with (3.4). Since p2 is compact we may apply the Riesz-Schauder theory to P (see Ref. 8, pp. 283-286), and conclude that the spectrum of P is the collection of the eigenvalues. Since 1 is not an eigenvalue of P it belongs to the resolvent set and I-P is onto. For l<p we observe that fs~l~c~(J//lp) c implies that ( I -P ) f ~ J //l l n ( J l p ) c because of (3.4), so the result follows from d//~ = (I-P)~'I that we have established before. We can also get the result ~'r=(I-P)~'p from the fact that the {Xi} are ~p-mixing, which implies that IlP"ll2~0. This will lead to limsup~(llP~ll2)~/~<l and, because of (3.4), to limsup,(llP~lla)~/~<l. The last fact gives the representation ( I-P~-ar-x~~176 Pit feJ/1; see Ref. 5, Remark 3 (we will not use this ] .I --#...~i=O J~ representation here). So ( I -p ) -i is a well-defined operator on J/p which is bounded w.r.t. Lp norm. Before we state our theorem we need the following definition; see Ref. 3, Definition (4.1): Definition 1. For a family of functions ~f' defined on S and e > 0 we define A(e, fir, cr inf{r: there exist functions gl ..... gr such that for every h~fff there is 1 <<.i<<.r for which Ihl ~<gi and E~(gi)<~e+E~(Ih[)}. In the proof of the following lemma we use some ideas from Ref. 5, Theorem 1. We may assume that the process (Xi) is double sided because of the stationarity. Also each f: S ~ ~ will be considered as f: f2 = S ~' ---, by putting f((Xi)):=f(Xo), so the UCLT in the lemma has the same meaning as before. Lemma 2. Let ~ be a class of measurable functions defined on S such that -1 ~<f~< 1, f~. Assume that (3.1) and (3.2) hold. Denote for n>~l, e>0 ~,~(n, e) = {fi -fz -E(fl --f2): fl ,f2 e ~, Ilfl -f2 -E(fl -f2)ll 1 ~< 2en -1/2} If S~(logO{u2,~,ll.lll})a/2du is finite and for every e>0 n 1/2 log[A(en-1/2 J~(n, e), ~)] ~ 0, then the UCLT for ~-holds. Proof. Put ~= { ( I -e ) -a [ f -E(f)]: fe~}. Since II(I-e) 111o~ <m, f# is uniformly bounded by C1 (say). For every gel# we define 
Uniform CLT 281 g: S Z ~ ~ by ~(X) = g(Xa) -Pg(Xo). Note that if g # 0 [in Z2(~ ) sense] then ~ #0 because otherwise g(X1) is measurable w.r.t, a(Xo), so g must be constant and hence 0, since ge~/2. Since I[PII~<I we have that {4: gel#} is uniformly bounded by C2 (say). Also {4: g~f#} ~HoOH-,, which means that g(TW) is a martingale difference for each g s fr We now define a metric d on { g: g ~ f# }: d(gl, g2)= (Elgl-g2l) m, gl, g2~ff (3.5) We note that ({4}, d) is relatively compact since ( I -p ) -i is bounded as an operator on J/1. We have [recall that p denotes the L2(f2) metric] and also p2(gl, g2)= (llg~-g2112) z-I-liP(g1-gz)l[2] 2 d2(gl, g2) >1 p2(g~, g2) > 0, 41 # g~ For notational purposes set p'(A,A) = p(g,, g2), A,Ae~ (3.6) p' is the appropriate metric for which we have to establish the tightness condition since this is the natural metric of the Gaussian limit. We need to show that For e > 0 there is 6 > 0 such that for large n p, (p,(~ufp<~6 i~=l( fl_ f2)(Xi)__E(fl_ f2) //,/1/2~e)~ ( 3 . 7 ) We observe that (3.7) follows from For e > 0 there is & > 0 such that for large n P* (sU p\p(gl,g2)<~~ i=l~'(gl--~'2)[Zi(X)]/nl/2~~ 13) (3.8) TO see this note for (I--P)ge=f~-E(f,.), i= 1, 2 we have (ft-f2)(X,)-E(ft--f2)-~ (g~-g2)[T~(X)] ~<2 (3.9) i=1 i=1 Our next task is to prove (3.8) by using Theorem 2. As for condition (a): IIA-falll<~u 2 implies that Ilfl-f2-E(f~-f2)ll~<~2u% which in turn 
282 Levental leads to Itg, -g21l, ~ [l(/-e)-~l] ,2u z, so d(41, 42) ~ (211(I-e)-'ll 1) 1/2u" We conclude that ~0~ (log D{u, {g}, d}) ~/2 du is finite. Condition (b): We choose C(e) = e, H(e) = 2C~ t/s, z = 1 + 3t/s and any ~)~'nG [ { 4}, an, d]. Condition (b)(i): a2(gl --42) = P((g, --g2) 2) --[P(gl -g2)] 2 (t/s) E(g, --g2) 2 = 2Cl(t/s) d2(4,, 42) Condition (b)(ii): We have to show that for every e > 0 P(sup ~ (4-4,)[Ti(X,]/n'/E>_.ze)~O (3.10) l ~i~n Note that d2(4, 4~)~< en 1/2, so {4-4#} ~-(4~-g2: Elgl-g2l ~< en-1/2, gl, g2 ~ ~} -(41 -g2: ElL -f2 --E(fx -f2)l ~< 2en-1/2, fl, f2 ~ ~} This, together with (3.9), shows that (3.10) will follow from Let gl,..., g~ be the A-approximating class for ~(n, e), where r = A(en -m, ~(n, e), ~). Since ~(n, e) is uniformly bounded by 4 we may assume that Ilgkllo~ ~<4, k= 1,..., r. Since E(gk)<<.3en -~/2, k= 1 ..... r, we get from (3.4) that I]Pgkll o~ <<-(t/s) 3en 1/2, k = 1 ..... r, Now we can calculate as follows: ~<P(max ~ gk(X,)/nm>~) \l<~k<~ri= 1 /) ~<r max P( ~. gk(Xi+l)--Pgk(Xi) F/1/2~/~ l~<k~<r \1i=1 2 exp{nl/2[n-1/2 log(r) --(e/8) arcsinh(s/6t)] } --, 0 The last inequality follows from (2.1): Ilgk(X~)--Pgk(Xo)lloo<<.4 and a2(gk(Xx) --Pgk(Xo)) <<. (t/s)II g211a ~< 12en-m(t/s). The proof is finished. Definition 2 (Ref. 2, 6.1). For ~-___L~(~) we define N~3(e, ~-, ~) as the smallest number m such that there exists {fl ..... fm}~_~ with the 
Uniform CLT 283 following property: For every f ~ there exist l~<i, j<~m such that f,.~<f~<fj and Ilfi-fjll~,(~) ~< e. The following is a generalization of Theorem 6.2.1 of Ref. 2 to Markov chains. Theorem 3. Let ~ be a class of real functions defined on S which are uniformly bounded. Assume that (3.1) and (3.2) hold. If ~o~ [log NE3(u 2. ~ , c~)] 1/2 du is finite, then the UCLT for ~ holds. Proof The result follows from Lemma 2 and an observation of Gine and Zinn, (3) Remark 4.2(1 ). [] 4. TWO EXAMPLES 1. The "baker transformation": Let S = {0, 1 }. We can think about (..., x_l, Xo, xl,...)eS 2~ as a point (x, y) in the unit square [-0, 1] : [0, 1] by putting x = 5Zo.<~ x~/U + 1 and y = ~1 <~ x-i/2( The Lebesgue measure on the unit square, to be denoted by re, is identifed with the product measure (1/2, 1/2) 2~ on {0, 1} 2~. T is known in this case as the "baker transformation." In terms of the unit square it is defined by T: (x, y) ~ (2x, y/2), 0 ~< x < 1/2 and T: (x, y)--, (2x-1, [y+ 1]/2), 1/2<x~< 1 ~----{ft( x, Y))o~<t~<l where f~(x, y)= 1EO,,3(y), 0~<x~< 1/2 = --1Eo, o(y ), 1/2<x~< 1 We use the notation Ti(x, y)= (x~, yi), (x, y)~ [-0, 1] : [0, 1], i=0, 1 ..... Claim 2. 5Y(Y~l<_i<~nft(xi, yi)/nl/2: O<~t<~ 1) --, Sr 0~<t~< 1), where G(t) is standard Brownian motion. Proof It is obvious that E(ft(x , y) [ y) = 0 for each 0 ~< t ~< 1, which means that ~~-HoGH_I. Next let us identify ~(G(t): 0~<t~<l): For 0~<s<t~<l we have E([Zl~i~,ft(xi, yi)/nl/2][~l<.i<<.,f~(xi, yi)/na/2]) =s and that is the covariance structure of standard Brownian motion. Now we verify the conditions of Theorem 2. Condition (a) is trivial. Condition (b): We take C(~) = 1, H(~) = 8, r = 1. We choose ~ = {fs: s=kn -1/2, k= 1,..., [nm]}. 
284 Levental Condition (b)(i): Note that a2((J)-f~)(xi, yi))= 1E~,,j(y~). It will be enough to show that P( sup ~ l[kn-t/2,(k+l)n-t/2](yi)~>Snt/2)---~O (4.1) \O<~k<~[nl/2] -1 l <.i<~n Assume for now that n = 22% m = 1, 2 ..... For such n we will show that P( sup ~ l[kn-L/2.(k+l)n-~/2](yi)2>n l/2)--*O \O<~k<~[nl/2] -1 l<~i<~n as m --* oo (4.2) we see that on k, so When we use the representation of O's and l's s ) does not depend La(Z 1 ~ i ~<. 1 Ek.-1/2 (k + 1).-1/21 (Y;)) does not depend on k either and we get (4.2) by showing nl/2p( ~, [1Eo,.-1/23(yi)-n-1/2]>nm)~O as m-*~ (4.3) l <<.i<~n To prove (4.3) we observe that Yk= 2 [ l [ o , n -m ] ( y i ) --n -1 /2 ] , k=O, 1,... 2km <i<~ (2k + l)m is an i.i.d, sequence (the Yk depend on disjoint subsets of the sequence of O's and l's), E(Yk) = O, II Ygll ~ ~< m and Var(Yg) <~ m2n -1/2 as follows from Var(Yk) ~< E ~ 1 [O,n-l/2](yi) 2km< i<<. (2k+ 1)m <~E(m ~ l[o,n_ll2](yi))~rn2-n1 /2 2km<i<~(2k+ 1)m From Bernstein's inequality we get nlJ2 ( n ,2j2) 0 ~ k ~ [n/2m] <~ nl/22 exp{ --(n/4)/[(n/2m)m2n -1/2 + 3 -lmnl/2] } (4.4) The last expression is of the order of n 1/2 exp(-nl/2/log2 n) ~ 0 as m ~ ~. Similarly we define Zk = ~ (1 E0,.-l/23(yi) --n m), k = 0, 1 .... (2k+ l)m<i<~(2k+2)m and we get nl/2P( ~ Zk>nl/2/2)---~O as m ~ (4.5) 0 <~ k ~ [n/2m ] 
Uniform CLT 285 We get (4.3) from (4.4) and (4.5), so we have proved (4.2) for n=2 2", m = 1, 2 ..... For 22" < n < 2 2(" + l) we calculate P ( sup \O<.k<~[nl/2]--I l <<i<~n ~<2(m+l)P ( l~<i~<2 1 [kn-l/2,(k+ 1).-1/23(Y~) > 8n 1/2) 2(m + 1) 1Eo, z ~3(Y;) > 8-2") ~<4-2('+a)P( ~ 2mlEo,2,.](yg)>2-2")~O as m ~ \1~<i~<2 as follows from (4.3). This proves (4.1). Condition (b)(ii): In the following argument the indices k and h will satisfy k = 0 ..... [n I/2] and h = 1 ..... [n~/4]. Using the same technique that we have used in proving (4.1) we can prove P(sukp,h\ l<~i<~nZ ltk. '/2+(h--1)n-3/4,~.-l/2+h.-3/4j(yi)>2nl/2)--*0 (4.6) NOW put gk, h =fkn-'/~+h.-3/4--fk.-l/~. First we want to show that PIsup ~ gk, h(xi, yi)/nm > ~/2} ~0 (4.7) ( k,h l<~i<~n Define a stopping time w~=n^max{O<~m:sup ~ a2(gk, h)(yi)/h<nl/42) k,n l<~i<~m From (4.6) it follows that P(wn < n)--, O, so to show (4.7) it is enough to prove \ k,h [<~i<~w n We have \ k,h l<~i<~Wn k,h l <~ i <~ wn <<. n 3/4 exp[(-enm/4) arcsinh(e/4)] --, 0 The last step is an application of Lemma 1. Take L=2hn~/4<~2nl/2 and e := en ~/2. We have proved (4.7). Now assume that kn -1/2 + (h-1)n 3/4 < s<~kn-i/2+hn-3/4. It follows that for 0~<x, y~ 1 we have [(fs--fkn-'/2 +(h--l)n-3/4)( x, Y)I ~< 1Ek. l/2 +(h--1)n-3/4,kn-l/2 +hn-3/'](y) 
286 Levental We conclude that P( sup ~ (f~--fk.-'~+Ch-1).-3/")(xe, Y3]>e/2) \0~<s~<l l<.i<.n ~<P sup ~ l [ k n -l /2 + ( h _ l ) n -3 /4 , k n -l /2 + h n -3 /4 ] ( y i ) 1/2 \ k,h l<~i<~n (4.8) as follows from (4.6). Condition (b)(ii) can now be verified by combining (4.7) and (4.8). Example 2. The case d(f, g)= IIf-gll~. In this case we get the following: Claim 3. Assume that ~ ~HoOH_I and -1 ~<f~< 1 for each f~o ~. If ~ I-log D{u 2, F, d}] 1/2 du is finite then the UCLT holds. Proof By completing o~ with respect to the d metric we may assume that (o~, d) is a compact metric space. We choose C = H = 1 and z = 2 and any ~e [~, a,, d]. Conditions (a) and (b)(i) are trivial. As for (b)(ii): First we observe that //--1/2 log D{en -1/2, {f -f g }, d} ~ 0 (4.9) This follows from the assumption that ~ I-log N{u 2, ~,~, d}]l/Zdu is finite: n-1/al-log D{en-1/2/4, ~, d}] 1/2 ~ 0, so n -1/2 log D{en-1/2/4, ~, d} ~ O, but D{en -1/2, {f-f~e},d}<<.D2{~n-m/a,~,d} and we get (4.9). Now let fr {gl, g2 ..... gN} E [{f--f~e}, en -~/2, d] where necessarily N~< D{en -1/2, {f --fz}, d}. We get P* (sup ~ (f-f~)[-Ti(X)]/nl/2>>.2e) k, f e .~" l <. i <~ n ~<P (max ~ g(TiX) /n~/2 >/e) \ gecg l<.i<~n <~D{en x/2,{f-f~},d}maxP( ~ g(TiX) /nl/2>~ e) g~f~ l<~i<<n <~ D( en-~/2, {f -f Je}, d} 2 exp[(-~n~/2/4) arcsinh(~)] as follows from (2.1). By (4.9) the last expression converges to 0.
