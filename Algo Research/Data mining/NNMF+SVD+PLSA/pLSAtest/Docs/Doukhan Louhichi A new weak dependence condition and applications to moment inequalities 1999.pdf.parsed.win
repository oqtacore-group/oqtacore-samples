Mixing sequences, functions of associated or Gaussian sequences, Bernoulli shifts as well as models with a Markovian representation are examples of the models considered. We establish Marcinkiewicz{ Zygmund, Rosenthal and exponential inequalities for general sequences of centered random variables. Inequalities are stated in terms of the decay rate for the covariance of products of the initial random variables subject to the condition that the gap of time between both products tends to innity. As applications of those notions, we obtain a version of the functional CLT and an invariance principle for the empirical process c 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Introduction We propose a new weak dependence condition for time series. This denition makes explicit the asymptotic independence between `past' and `future'; this means that the `past' is progressively forgotten. In terms of the initial time series, `past' and `future' are elementary events given through nite-dimensional marginal. Roughly speaking, for convenient functions h and k, we shall assume that Cov(h(`past'); k(`future')) is small when the distance between the `past' and the `future' is suciently large. Asymptotic are expressed in terms of the distance between indices of the initial time series in the `past' and `future' terms; the convergence is not assumed to hold uniformly Corresponding author.

314 P. Doukhan, S. Louhichi / Stochastic Processes and their Applications 84 (1999) 313{ 342 on the dimension of the marginal involved. As a special case of such a denition, Rosenblatt (1956) introduced strong mixing conditions but such conditions refer rather to -algebra than to random variables. On the one hand, a main inconvenience of mixing assumptions is the diculty of checking them; e.g. Doukhan (1994) provides, with evident diculties, explicit bounds of the decay of mixing sequences. On the other hand, an important property of associated random variables is that zero correlation implies independence (see Newman, 1984). This means that one may hope that dependence will appear in this case only through the covariance structure, and also justies the study of such processes: indeed a covariance is much easier to compute than a mixing coecient. The aim of this paper is to provide a unifying approach including mixing, association, Gaussian sequences and Bernoulli shifts. Sometimes we shall not obtain optimal results when they are particularized to some special subframe. In this frame we obtain moment inequalities and functional CLT for the partial sums and for the empirical distribution function. Those results apply to our classes of examples. In the sequel, N; Z;R denote respectively the set of nonnegative integers, integers, and the real line. Let (Xn)n2N be a sequence of random variables (r.v.s) centered at expectation. For stationary independent sequences of centered random variables, we recall the Marcinkiewicz{Zygmund inequality (cf. Petrov, 1995) EjX1 + +Xnjq =O(nq=2) (1.1) and the Rosenthal inequality (cf. also Petrov, 1995) EjX1 + +Xnjq6Cq0@Xn i=1 EjXijq +   Xn i=1 EjXij2!q=21A: (1.2) Our dependence conditions on the process yielding the bound (1.1) or (1.2) only require a suitable non-correlation between the `past' and the `future' of the process. Indeed, we preceive that to bound jE(X1 + + Xn)qj for integers q we only have to bound the covariance quantity jCov(Xt1 : : : Xtm; Xtm+1 : : : Xtq)j in terms of the gap tm+1 ?tm =r, between both groups of variables dened by t166tq and m, for m 2 f1; : : : ; qg as in Doukhan and Portal (1983). Under positive dependence, the bound (1.1) was developed in Birkel (1988a) under conditions on the (q + )th-order moments of Xn and on the decay of the covariance function of the process (those conditions are optimal). For strongly mixing sequences, this bound was rst obtained by Yokoyama (1980). Up to now, the best assumptions yielding the bound (1.1) under strongly mixing conditions were given in Rio (1994). His assumptions are given in terms of the quantile function of the sequence (Xn). A more precise bound for (1.1) for dependent sequences is EjX1 + +Xnjq6Cqnq=2 max i (EjXijq+)q=(q+): (1.3) Such inequalities are proved for associated sequences in Birkel (1988a): the constants Cq only involve correlations Corr(Xi; Xj). Our assumptions seem to be sharp. In particular, for associated sequences of bounded r.v.s, Birkel's conditions yielding (1.3)
P. Doukhan, S. Louhichi / Stochastic Processes and their Applications 84 (1999) 313{ 342 315 specialize to our decay condition, and for strongly mixing sequences Rio's (1994) assumptions are reached. However, the use of combinatorics restricts us to even integer exponents. Rosenthal type inequalities are also given in Doukhan and Portal (1983) and Doukhan (1994), and we also obtain analogues of the inequalities in Rio (1994) in our more general frame. For associated sequences, analogues of inequalities (1.2) are proved by Shao and Yu (1996). We refer also to Bahtin and Bulinski (1997) where moment inequalities are established for multiindexed sums of random variables in terms of covariances of some test functions. Let F be a class of real-valued functions, such that for each f 2 F there exists an integer n>1 such that f is dened on Rn. The integer n depends on the specic function considered. We now introduce Denition 1. The sequence (Xn)n2N of r.v.s is called (;F;   )-weak dependent, if there exists a class F of real-valued functions, a sequence =(r)r2N decreasing to zero at innity, and a function   with arguments (h; k; u; v) 2 F2N2 such that for any u-tuple (i1; : : : ; iu) and any v-tuple (j1; : : : ; jv) with i166iu <iu+r6j166jv, one has jCov(h(Xi1; : : : ; Xiu); k(Xj1; : : : ; Xjv ))j6  (h; k; u; v)r ; (1.4) for all functions h; k 2 F that are dened respectively on Ru and Rv. In the previous denition r always denotes the gap in time between `past' and `future'. Notice that the sequence depends both on the class F and on the function   . The function   may really depend on its arguments, contrarily e.g. to the case of mixing bounded sequences. An important point in the previous denition is its heredity through appropriate images as is the case for mixing conditions. Doeblin and Fortet (1937), Rosenblatt (1956), Withers (1981), Tran (1990), Birkel (1992), among others, obtained limit theorems under some of the notions of weak dependence from Denition 1. In order to justify this denition, we reformulate a general case of Theorem 18:4:1 in Ibragimov and Linnik (1971) in terms of our weak dependence conditions. Dene the class of \complex" exponential functions E = fhs;u; (s; u) 2 R Ng; (1.5) by hs:=hs;u belongs to E if and only if there exist a real number s and an integer u>1 such that hs(x1; : : : ; xu)=f(s(x1++xu)), where f is the real-valued function dened on R by f(x) = cos x or f(x) = sin x. Corollary A. Let (Xn)n2N be a stationary sequence fullling EX0 =0 and EX 2 0 <1. Suppose that the sequence (Xn)n2N satises a (; E;   )-weak dependence condition with some bounded function   dened on E2 N2. Assume that 1. limn!1 n = 0. 2. limn!1 Var Sn=n = 2>0. 3. EjSnj2+= O(n1+=2); for some >0. Then Sn=pn converges in distribution to N(0; 2).

Louhichi / Stochastic Processes and their Applications 84 (1999) 313{ 342 Withers (1981) proved the CLT for non-stationary triangular arrays of l-mixing sequences by using the blocking technique, his ideas yield us to the present denition. We also refer to Jakubowski (1993) (his condition B is analogous to the weak dependence condition of Corollary A: covariance for \complex" exponentials). A paper devoted to investigate the basic properties of the functional estimation of a density in this framework is in preparation. Extensions of the present notions to random elds, continuous time processes or vector-valued sequences will be considered in forthcoming papers. The paper is organized as follows. Section 6.2 is devoted to give our main results. Examples in Section 3 show that (;F;   )-weak dependence holds in many cases of interest. Our results are applied to important classes of modelling and the conditions that yield the bound (1.1) or (1.2) are discussed. Section 6.4 is aimed to give applications of the previous moment inequalities to a Donsker Corollary and to the convergence of the empirical process constructed from any stationary and weakly dependent sequences. The proof of the main results is given in Section 6:5. Section 6:6 is dedicated to the proofs related to Section 6.3, concerned with modelling. 2. Results 2.1. Weak dependence We rst introduce some classes of function. Set L1 for the set of real-valued and bounded functions on some space Ru. Moreover Lip(h)=supx6=y jh(x)?h(y)j=jjx?yjj1 denotes the Lipschitz modulus of a function h : Ru ! R where Ru is equipped with its l1-norm. Dene L= fset of bounded Lipschitz functions: Ru ! R; for some u 2 Ng: (2.1) The class L will be used together with functions   dened by   (h; k; u; v) = c(u; v)(Lip(h); Lip(k)); (2.2) where denotes some locally bounded function on R2+ (here and in the sequel R+ is the set of non-negative real numbers). The functions h and k are dened respectively on Ru and Rv; c is some function dened on N2. In the examples (x; y) = const: xy or (x; y) = const: maxfx; yg (cf. Section 3). In some cases, the class L will be replaced by the smaller class L1 = fh 2 L; jjhjj161g: (2.3) The inclusions EL1 L imply that Corollary A holds under L1-weak dependence. In fact we obtain Proposition 1. Let (Xn) be a stationary centered sequence. Suppose that EX 2 0<1 and that conditions (2) and (3) of Corollary A are fullled. Suppose moreover that the sequence (Xn) is (;L1;   )-weak dependent; where the function   is dened as in (2:2) by c(u; v) = (u + v)d and   (h; k) = (Lip(h) + Lip(k))c; for some d>0;

(We prove Proposition 1 in Section 4.) Dene now for some x>0 the function gx : R ! R by gx(y) = 5x6y ?5x6?y; (2.5) where 5A denotes the indicator function of the event A. We shall also consider the class I = ui=1 gxi ; xi 2 R+; u2N(2.6) with   (h; k; u; v) = c(u; v). In the examples (cf. Section 3), the function c is shown to be either c(u; v) = minfu; vg or c(u; v) = (u+v)2. The following lemma links I-weak dependence with L-weak dependence; indeed, examples are mainly proved to satisfy a weak dependence condition w.r.t. the class L. It will show that the weaker L0 \ C1b-weak dependence condition dened by L0 = ui=1fi; fi 2 L; fi :R!R; i = 1; : : : ; u; u 2 N; C1b denotes the set of dierentiable functions with continuous and bounded partial derivatives, and   c;1(h; k; u; v) = c(u; v)maxfLip(h); Lip(k)g (2.7) or   c;2(h; k; u; v) = c(u; v)Lip(h)Lip(k); (2.8) (for a suitable function c) implies I-weak dependence under concentration assumptions. Lemma 1. Let (Xn) be a sequence of r.v.s fullling for some >0; C>0 C() :=sup x2R sup i P(x6Xi6x + )6C: (2.9) If the sequence (Xn) is (L0 ;L0 \ L1 \ C1b;   c;1)-weak dependent; then (Xn) is (I;I;   )-weak dependent with I;r = =(1+) L0;r and   (h; k; u; v) = 2(8C)1=(1+)(u + v)1=(1+)[c(u; v)]=(1+): If (Xn) is (L0 ;L0 \ L1 \ C1b;   c;2)-weak dependent; then it is (I;I;   )-weak dependent with I;r = =(2+) L0;r and   (h; k; u; v) = (8C)2=(2+)(u + v)2=(2+)[c(u; v)]=(2+): The following lemma allows one to replace L by the wider class ~Lof (perhaps unbounded) real-valued and Lipschitz functions dened on any Ru-space.

If the sequence (Xn)n2N is (;L;   )-weak dependent; with   associated to a coordinatewise non-decreasing function and if supn2N EX 2 n<1; then the sequence (Xn)n2N is also (; ~L;   )-weak dependent. Remark. Contrarily to the covariance inequalities for mixing sequences we do not need higher moments or tail assumptions (see Rio, 1993) to obtain bounds for a covariance in the case of L-weak dependence. Thus, we rederive Rio's (1993) results without additional tail assumptions. Proof of Lemma 2. First we note that for any function f 2 ~Lthere holds jf(x1; : : : ; xu)j 6jf(0; : : : ; 0)j + Lip(f)Puj=1 jxj j. Square integrability implies Ef2(Xi1; : : : ; Xiu)<1 for any indices i1; : : : ; iu 2 N. Consider now the continuous and piecewise linear function iM : R ! [ ? M;M], which is the identity on [ ? M;M] and is constant outside this interval. Then Lip(iM) = 1 and the function iMof is in L and satises Lip(iMof)6Lip(f). We thus conclude by using the dominated convergence Corollary and 0s monotonicity. 2.2. Moment inequalities Let (Xn)n2N be a sequence of centered r.v.s. Let Sn =Pni=1 Xi. In this section, we obtain bounds for jESqn j, when q 2 N and q>2. Denition 2. Let (Xn) be a sequence of centered r.v.s. Dene, for positive integer r, the coecient of weak dependence as non-decreasing sequences (Cr; q)q>2 such that sup j Cov(Xt1 : : : Xtm; Xtm+1 : : : Xtq)j= : Cr; q; where the supremum is taken over all ft1; : : : ; tqg such that 16t166tq and m; r satisfy tm+1 ? tm = r. In this paper, we provide explicit bounds of Cr; q in order to obtain inequalities for moments of the partial sums Sn. We shall consider two types of assumptions, either there exist constants c;>0 such that for any convenient q-tuple ft1; : : : ; tqg (as in the denition): jCov(Xt1 : : : Xtm; Xtm+1 : : : Xtq)j6cqMq?2r ; (2.10) or, denoting by QX the quantile function of jX j (inverse of the tail function t ! P(jX j>t)), jCov(Xt1 : : : Xtm; Xtm+1 : : : Xtq)j6cZ r 0 QXt1 (x) : : : QXtq (x) dx: (2.11) The bound (2.10) holds mainly for bounded sequences such that jjXnjj16M. E.g. (;L1;   )-weak dependence yields the bounds Cr; q6 max 16m<q   (jm; j(q?m); m; q?m)Mqr;

Our rst result is the following Marcinkiewicz{Zygmund inequality. Theorem 1. Let (Xn)n2N be a sequence of centered r.v.s fullling for some xed q 2 N; q>2 Cr; q =O(r?q=2) as r !1: (2.12) Then there exists a positive constant B not depending on n for which jESqn j6Bnq=2: (2.13) 2.3. Rosenthal-type inequalities The following lemma gives moment inequalities of order q 2 f2;4g (its proof is essentially in Billingsley, 1968). Lemma 3. If (Xn)n2N is a sequence of centered r.v.s; then ES2n62nXn?1 r=0 Cr; 2; ES4n64!8< : n Xn?1 r=0 Cr; 2!2 + n Xn?1 r=0 (r + 1)2Cr;49= ;: (2.14) Let us note that Lemma 3 in Bryc and Smolenski (1993) gives a Rosenthal-type inequality of order q 2 [2; 4] (where q is not necessarily an integer); under a suitable decay of the so-called maximal correlation coecients (recall that this mixing condition is more restrictive than ours). The following theorems deal with higher order moments. Theorem 2. Let q be some xed integer not less than 2. Suppose that the dependence coecients Cr;p associated to the sequence (Xn) satisfy; for every nonnegative integer p; p6q; and for some positive constants M; ; C Cr;p6CepMp?2r : (H) Then; for any integer n>2 jESqn j6(2q ? 2)!

In order to consider the unbounded case, we shall consider (;I;   )-weak dependence where   denotes   (h; k; u; v) = c(u; v) and I is the class of functions dened by (2.6).

In the special case of strongly mixing and stationary sequences, this is Theorem 1 in Rio (1994) (cf. also Rio, 1997). The restriction of working with even integer exponents nds its compensation in the explicit form of the constants. 2.4. Exponential inequality For any positive integers n and q>2, dene Mq;n :=n Xn?1 r=0 (r + 1)q?2Cr; q6An q! q ; (H) where is some positive constant and An is a sequence independent of q. We shall prove as a consequence of Theorem 2 and Markov inequality that an exponential inequality holds. Corollary 1. Suppose that (H1) and (H2) hold for some sequence An>1 for any n>2. Then for any positive real number x P(jSnj>xpAn)6A exp(?Bpx); (2.16) for universal positive constants A and B. Remark. (1) One may choose the explicit values A = e4+1=12p8, and B = e5=2. (2) Let us note that condition (H2) holds if Cr; q6C2Mq?2eqe?br for positive constants C; ; ; b, as soon as jjXnjj16M and jjXnjj26, for any integer n>0. In such a case An = n2. E.g. this holds under (;L;   )-weak dependence if r = O(e?br) and   (h; k; u; v)6 e(u+v)Lip(h)Lip(k) for some >0. (3) The use of combinatorics in those inequalities makes them relatively weak. Ep.g. Bernstein inequality, valid for independent sequences allows to replace the term x in the previous inequality by x2 under the same assumption n2>1; in the mixing cases analogue inequalities are also obtained by using coupling arguments (not available here), e.g. the case of absolute regularity is studied in Doukhan (1994). 3. Examples In this section, we apply the preceding results to particular classes of sequences. In each case, we shall check condition (H1), providing coecients Cr; q. We will also make explicit the underlying weak dependence properties of the sequence.

The lemmas below exhibit the weak dependence structure of the associated sequences under conditions involving only the covariance structure of the process. We note here a remarkable property of association: independence is equivalent to zero correlation (cf. Esary et al., 1967). 3.1.1. Weak dependence and association Lemma 4.

Marcinkiewicz{Zygmund inequality under association Theorem 2 together with Lemma 5, implies the Marcinkiewicz{Zygmund inequality (i.e. the bound (1.1) for an even integer q), under the condition Z r 0 Qq(u)du = O(r?q=2): (3.5) Let us compare this result with Theorem 1 in Birkel (1988a). Suppose that sup i P(jXij>t) =O(t?q?) ast !1 and for some >0; (3.6) then Q(t) = O(t?1=(q+)) and (3.5) holds whenever r = O(r?q(q+)=2). Clearly, the tail condition (3.6) is weaker than the following one (condition (2.1) in Birkel, 1988a) sup i EjXijq+<+1: However, note that after simple calculations the preceeding decay on r implies the condition (2.2) in Birkel (1988a). Moreover, the index of dependence, r , that we investigate here is independent of any moment assumption while Birkel (1988a) uses explicitly the covariance structure of the process (and not the one of indicators); our inequality is thus also more intrinsic. Now, if the associated sequence is bounded then our condition in (2.12) is equivalent to the condition (2.4) in Birkel (1988a) that implies Marcinkiewicz{Zygmund inequality. This condition is shown to be optimal (cf. Birkel, 1988a). 3.1.3. Rosenthal-type inequality under association Associated r.v.s are shown to be (;I;   )-weak dependent (cf. Lemma 5). Hence, a new Rosenthal inequality for associated r.v.s follows from Theorem 3. It is more important in practice to obtain moment inequalities for non-monotonic functions of associated r.v.s; indeed, this property fails to be hereditary under such transformations. Theorem 4. Let (Xn)n2N be a sequence of associated r.v.s. Let f be a real-valued Pfunction with bounded rst derivative. Suppose that Ef(Xi) = 0 and dene Sn(f) = n i=1 f(Xi).

Remark. Let us note that Shao and Yu (1996) prove a general Rosenthal's inequality for non-monotonic functions of associated r.v.s. We compare their result with Theorem 4. The last term obtained on the right-hand side of (3.7) is slightly better than the corresponding one in Shao and Yu (1996) by a multiplicative factor n; the rst one is

Hence, Theorem 4 is a good competitor with the result of Shao and Yu (1996) for the special case of even integer exponents. 3.2. Strongly mixing sequences As a measure of dependence, Rosenblatt (1956) introduced the strong mixing coecients. For any two -algebra A and B, let (A;B) = sup (A;B)2AB jCov(5A; 5B)j: The strong mixing coecients of the sequence (Xn)n2Z are dened by n = sup k2Z (Ak ;Bk+n) where Ak = (Xi; i6k) and Bk = (Xi; i>k): For relevant literature on mixing, the reader is deferred to Doukhan (1994). The following lemma makes explicit the simple weak dependence structure of strongly mixing sequences. Lemma 6 (Rosenblatt, 1956). If the sequence (Xn)n2Z is strongly mixing; then it is (; L1;   )-weakly dependent with   (h; k; u; v)=4jjhjj1jjkjj1.

Let us note the remarkable analogy between associated r.v.s and Gaussian processes (compare Lemma 4 with Lemma 8). Other moment inequalities for Gaussian processes better than the one obtained here are given in Shao (1995). He obtains such Rosenthal inequalities under weak assumptions on the decay of the -mixing coecients (only logarithmic decay rates are needed). Now a stationary and Gaussian sequence is also -mixing if the spectral density of the process is bounded below, and n6 1 inf f() 1Xk=n jCov(X0; Xk)j !0 asn!1 (cf. Doukhan, 1994 for a proof). Remark. More general sequences satisfying the weak dependence condition dened as in (2.8) with c(u; v) = (u+v)2, may be obtained by combinations: this is the case for the sum of processes Xn =Yn +Zn, where the Gaussian process (Yn) is independent of the associated sequence (Zn). 3.4. Bernoulli shifts Now, we consider the weak dependence structure of the following class of Bernoulli shifts. Denition 4. Let (i)i2Z be a sequence of independent real-valued r.v.s and F be a measurable function dened on RZ. A Bernoulli shift is a sequence (Ui)i2Z dened by Ui = F(i?j; j 2 Z): (3.8) A main attraction of such sequences is that they provide examples of processes that are weakly dependent, but not mixing (see Rosenblatt, 1980). This way of constructing stationary sequences is very natural. Chaotic expansions of Gaussian functionals or, in the discrete time case, Volterra expansions are indeed a standard way of modelling stationary processes. Denition 5. For any positive integer k; we set k = sup i2Z EjF(i?j; j 2 Z)?F(i?j5jjj<k; j 2 Z)j: Such sequences (k)k are related to the modulus of uniform continuity of F. The sequence (k)k is evaluated under regularity conditions on the function F. In fact, if jF(ui: i 2 Z) ? F(vi: i 2 Z)j6Xi2Z aijui ? vijb; for some positive constants (ai)i2Z; 0<b61 and if the sequence (i)i2Z has nite bth-order moment, then k6Pjij>k aiEjijb. The following lemma is aimed to prove a weak dependence property of such sequences.
P. Doukhan, S. Louhichi / Stochastic Processes and their Applications 84 (1999) 313{ 342 325 Lemma 9. The sequence (Un ? EUn)n2Z is (;L;   )-weak dependent; with   (h; k; u; v) = 4(ujjkjj1Lip(h) + vjjhjj1Lip(k)) and r = r=2: Remark. More general processes have such weak dependence properties. E.g. instead of independence, assume that the sequence (n)n2Z satises a (;L1;  )-weak dependence condition; then the process (Un)n2Z is (;L1;   )-weak dependent with r = r; + r=2 and   (h; k; u; v) =  (h; k; u; v) + 4(uLip(h) + vLip(k)): Such hereditry property of weak dependence is unknown under mixing. Lemma 9, together with some elementary calculations, yields a bound for the coef-cients Cr; q associated to some bounded functions of the sequence (Ui)i2Z. Corollary 2. Let (i)i2Z be a sequence of independent r.v.s. Let (Ui)i2Z be the sequence dened as in (3:8). Let Xi = fi(Ui) ? Efi(Ui); where the functions (fi)i2Z satisfy jjfijj161=2 and Lip(fi)6K. Then the coecients Cr; q associated to the sequence (Xi)i2N satisfy Cr; q68qKr=2: Remark. Note that condition (H1) of Theorem 2 is satised, yielding new Rosenthal inequalities for such sequences. Remark. Let (i)i2Z be a sequence of independent Bernoulli variables with parameter s. The AR(1) process (Ui) with innovation r.v.s (i) and AR parameter a 2 ]0; 12] are dened by Ui = aUi?1 + i =Xj>0 aji?j : This sequence satises the requirement of Lemma 9, with F(ui; i 2 Z) =Pi>0 aiui; and k = sPi>k ai; but it is shown to be non-mixing (e.g. in Rosenblatt, 1980). Note that the process ((?1)nUn) is neither mixing nor associated, but concentration holds (e.g. Un is uniform if s = 12; and it has a Cantor marginal distribution if s = 13). 3.5. Models with a Markovian representation Let (i)i2N be a sequence of independent r.v.s and F be a measurable function. Let (Xi)i2N be the Markov chain dened by Xn+1 = F(Xn; n+1): (3.9) The initial distribution X0 is supposed to be independent of the sequence (i)i2N. We suppose that F satises EjF(0; 1)ja<1 and EjF(x; 1) ? F(y; 1)ja6ajx ? yja; (C1) for some a>1 and 06<1. Duo (1996) shows that under the condition (C1), the Markov chain (Xi)i2N has a stationary law with nite moment of order a. In the sequel, we suppose that X0 has as distribution (i.e. the Markov chain is stationary).
326 P. Doukhan, S. Louhichi / Stochastic Processes and their Applications 84 (1999) 313{ 342 Lemma 10. If the Markov chain dened as in (3:9) satises (C1), then it is (;L;   )-weak dependent with   (h; k; u; v) = 2 min(ujjkjj1Lip(h); vjjhjj1Lip(k)) and r = rEjX0j: Corollary 3. Let (Xi)i2N be the Markov chain dened as in (3:9). Suppose that (Xi)i2N satises the condition (C1). Let for i 2 N; Yi =gi(Xi)?Egi(Xi) where the functions gi:R ! R satisfy jjgijj161 and Lip(gi)6K. Then the coecients Cr; q associated to the sequence (Yi)i2N satisfy Cr; q62qKrEjX0j: Remark. Let us note that condition (H1) of Theorem 2 is satised by this Markov chain (Xi)i2N. Hence, we obtain Rosenthal inequalities which seem to be new. 4. Applications Let (Xn)n2N be a stationary sequence. In this section, we investigate some properties of the Donsker line and of the empirical process constructed from the stationary sequence (Xn)n2N. For associated sequences, such a result can be found in the papers of Newman (1984), Newman and Wright (1983) or in Bulinski and Keane (1996) for random elds. 4.1. Functional central limit theorem Here we obtain a functional extension of the CLT in Proposition 1 under (;L1;   )-weak dependence. Dene Sn(t) = 1 pn X[nt] k=1 Xk ; where 06t61 and [x] denotes the integer part of the real number x. We suppose that the (;L1;   )-weak dependence holds with   (h; k; u; v) = (u+v)d(Lip(h) + Lip(k))c; for some functions h; k dened respectively on Ru;Rv and for some constants d>0, and 06c62. Theorem 5. Assume that the centered and stationary sequence (Xn)n2N fulls the (;L1;   )-weak dependence conditions where   is dened as before and EjX0j4+<1 for some >0. Assume that r = O(r?D) with D>d and D>2 + 4(2 ? c)=. Then limn!1 ES2n =1 implies that 2=limn!1 ES2n =n>0 and that (Sn(t))t2[0;1] converges to W for some standard Brownian motion W in the Skohorod space D([0; 1]). Remark. Having in view the examples of Section 3 we can restrict ourselves to c; d=1 which correspond to Bernoulli shifts; the assumption of the theorem becomes D>2+ 4(for bounded r.v.s. this is only D>2).
P. Doukhan, S. Louhichi / Stochastic Processes and their Applications 84 (1999) 313{ 342 327 For c = d = 2, which is the case of both associated and Gaussian sequences, this is D>2. Proof of Theorem 5. Using Lemma 3 and the maximal inequality in Moricz et al. (1982), it is easy to see that assumption (3) of Corollary A holds (together with the tightness of the sequence of processes (Sn(t)t2[0;1]) if for any integers i; j; k such that 06i6j<k6l 1Xm=0 mjEX0Xmj<1 and Cov(XiXj; XkXl) =O((k ? j)?2): (4.1) Condition (1) of Corollary A classically holds with 2 6= 0 from (4.1) and from limn!1 ES2n=1. Now di convergence follows from Proposition 1. Hence it is enough to prove the relations (4.1). We rst control the covariance jEX0Xr j. For this write as in Lemma 2, Xk = Yk + (iM(Xk) ? EiM(Xk )). Markov inequality yields for 0<p<4 + ; EjYk jp62pEX 4+0 Mp?4?. Now the covariance inequality implies Cov(iM(X0); iM(Xr))6M22d(2=M)cr . An optimization w.r.t. M yields jEX0Xr j= O((2+)=(4+?c) r ): We now prove the bound jCov(XiXj; XkXl)j=O(=(4+?c) k?j ). Indeed, the previous covariance is written as the sum of 24 covariance terms with the form Cov(U1U2; U3U4) for Uj's which are either in fYi; Yj; Yk; Ylg or are bounded by 2M. Apply the weak dependence property in the case where each U is bounded. Thus, the Markov inequality implies that this covariance is O(M?+ M4?2cr). An optimization on M, yields the result. Remark. This theorem allows to consider examples of Bernoulli shifts or Lipschitz Markov models as shown by Lemmas 9 and 10 (since for h; k 2 L1;   (h; k; u; v)64(u+ v)(Lip(h) _ Lip(k)); resp:   (h; k; u; v)62(u + v)(Lip(h) ^ Lip(k)). Moreover, the case of strongly mixing sequences corresponds to c=0. We may also consider the L-weak dependence as in the examples of Gaussian or associated sequences. Using Lemma 2, the dependence condition yields r = O(r?D) with D>d and D>2 + 2c=: We conclude that Donsker theorem holds for each class of examples from Section 3. 4.2. Empirical processes Here we prove the tightness of the empirical processes under weak dependence conditions. We assume without loss of generality that the marginal distribution of this sequence is the uniform law on [0; 1]. We denote by Fn(t) = 1n Xn i=1 5Xi6t and Un(t) =pn[Fn(t)?t]: The sequence (Xn) is assumed to satisfy the following weak dependence condition: sup f2FCov  Y2 i=1 f(Xti ); Y4 i=3 f(Xti )!6r ; (4.2)

Let (Xn) be a stationary sequence fullling (4:2) with r = O(r?5=2?); for some >0: (4.3) Then the sequence of processes (fUn(t); t 2 [0; 1]g)n>0 is tight in the Skohorod space D([0; 1]). Comments. Stationary associated sequences (see Section 3.1) satisfy the requirement of Proposition 2 if r = O(r?5=2?). Thus, the condition in Yu (1993) is obtained using the inequality (3.4). However, in this case, the recent paper by Louhichi (1998) ameliorates it in the sense that tightness is shown to hold if Cov(X0; Xr) = O(r?a), for a>4. In the same way, stationary mixing sequences satisfy the conditions of Proposition 2 if r = O(r?5=2?). This condition is slightly better than Yoshihara's condition r = O(r?3?) (cf. Yoshihara, 1973). It is also slightly worse than the corresponding result in Rio (1997). Finally, we note that Theorem 2:3 in Shao and Yu (1996), concerned with -mixing may also be compared with ours in the Gaussian case as in Section 3.3. Proof of Proposition 2. Let a=5=2+. The moment inequality (2.14), together with conditions (4.2) and (4.3), yields the existence of a positive constant C such that for any s; t in [0; 1] jjUn(t) ? Un(s)jj46C8< : Xn?1 r=0 r?a ^ jt ?sj!1=2 + 1n Xn?1 r=0 (r + 1)2r!1=49= ; 6C8>< >: 0@ X r>jt?sj?1=a r?a1A1=2+ 0@ X r<jt?sj?1=a jt ? sj1A1=2+ n(2?a)=49>= >; 6Cfjt ? sj(a?1)=2a + n(2?a)=4g: Now it follows from Theorem 2:1 in Shao and Yu (1996) that the sequence fUn(t); t 2 [0; 1]g is tight. Next we prove a functional CLT using the previous proposition and the smoothing technique in Lemma 1. In the following, we assume that the sequence is (;L1;   )-weak dependent with   1(h; k; u; v) = (Lip(h) _ Lip(k))(u + v) or  2(h; k; u; v) = Lip(h)Lip(k)min(u; v): Theorem 6. Let (Xn) be a stationary sequence; with Xn uniformly distributed on [0; 1]. Suppose that (Xn) is either (;L1;   1)-weak dependent; with r = O(r?5?); (4.4)

(1) As a consequence of this theorem note that a (;L1;  1) weakly dependent Bernoulli shift (i.e. such that r ! 0) with r=O(r?a) and with uniform marginal distributions has the following properties: its empirical process is a tight sequence in D([0; 1]) if a>5 and it is convergent if a>11. This general result seems to be new. (2) The limiting process is the generalization of Brownian bridge for dependent sequences, the term corresponding to k = 0 in the covariance is the only one in the independent case and it corresponds to the Brownian bridge. (3) The use of the space L1 allows to work with each of the class of models in the previous section (cf. the last remark at the end of the previous subsection). This yields really new results for the cases of Bernoulli shifts and also, apparently, for Markov sequences. We now prove Theorem 6. We rst propose as a lemma a version of the CLT under weak dependence conditions. A method to prove the CLT for the weakly dependent r.v.s ((Xi))i2N is mentioned by Ibragimov et al. (1971) in their Theorems 18:4:1 and 18:4:2. The idea is to split Sn into Bernstein's blocks Sn = Xk i=1 i + Xk+1 i=1 i:=Zk + Z0 k+1; i = ip+X(i?1)q (i?1)(p+q)+1(Xj); i= i(Xp+q) ip+(i?1)q+1(Xj) for 16i6k: and k+1=Pnk(p+q)+1 (Xj), where p=p(n); q=q(n); k=[n=p+q] are integer-valued functions satisfying p!1; q!1; q= o(p); p= o(n) asn!1: (4.6) Lemma 11.

Proof of Lemma 11. The proof is similar to the proof of Lemma 3:1 of Withers (1981) and will be omitted. Proof of Corollary A. By (1) and (2) of Corollary A, Condition B of Jakubowski (1993) holds. By (2) and (3), fS2n =Var(Sn)g is uniformly integrable. Following step by step the proof of Theorem 2 in Jakubowski and Szewczak (1990), we verify conditions (9:5){(9:7) of Theorem 9:5 of Jakubowski (1993). Hence, Sn=pVar(Sn) converges in distribution to N(0; 2). Finally, the proof is complete using condition 2 of Corollary A. Proof of Proposition 1. We must nd some positive integers p and q that full all the requirement of Lemma 11 (with (x) = x); more precisely we may have lim n!1p?2qn = 0; (4.11) and lim n!1 Xk j=2   (ft=n; gt=n; p; p(j ?1))q = 0; for any t 2 R; (4.12) where k denotes the integer part of n=(p + q); 2n = Var Sn and ft; gt are arbitrary functions in E dened by (1.5). We deduce rst, from the weak dependence considered, that condition (4.12) holds as soon as lim n!1kd+1pdq=nc=2 = 0: (4.13) Now let p = [n]; q = [n] with (2(1 + d) ? c + 2D)=2(2D + 1)_0<<<1: This choice of p and q is possible since d ? c=2<D. Now, p and q so chosen full (4.13), (4:6) and (4.11). Proof of Theorem 6. Let (ti)16i6m be some xed real numbers. The convergence in distribution of (Un(t1); : : : ; Un(tm)) follows if the sequence ((Xi))i2N, with dened by (x) =Pm j=1 j(5x6tj ? tj), satises the conditions of Lemma 11. Here, (i)16i6m are xed real numbers such that Pmi=1 i 6= 0. First we note that Var Sn=n converges under (;L1;   2) (resp.

We say that a sequence (Uq)q2N satises the convexity condition (H0), if for every integers q and p such that 26p6q ? 1 U~p6U~(p?2)=(q?2) q U~(q?p)=(q?2) 2 : (H) A Technical Lemma. If the sequence (U~q)q>0 satises (H0); then it satises also condition (5.3). In fact, for any m: 26m6q ? 1, condition (H0) together with some elementary calculations yields (U~m=2 2 _ U~m)(U~(q?m)=2 2 _ U~q?m)6max(U~q=2 2 ;U~m=2 2 U~q?m;U~m U~(q?m)=2 2 ;U~m U~q?m) 6(U~q=2 2 _ U~q): Remark. If the coecients (Cr;p(t1))p dened as in Lemma 15 satisfy (H0), then the sequence V~q(n) = Xn t1=1 Xn?1 r=0 (r + 1)q?2Cr; q(t1); satises (5.3). Let us check this remark. Using (H0) and some elementary estimations, we obtain V~ p(n)6V~ (p?2)=(q?2) q (n)V~ (q?p)=(q?2) 2 (n): Thus condition (H0) holds for (V~ p(n))p which satises also (5.3). Proof of Theorem 1. By induction on q, and using Lemmas 14, 15 and condition (2.12), it is easy to check that Aq(n)6Cqnq=2. Hence Theorem 1 follows from (5.9).
P. Doukhan, S. Louhichi / Stochastic Processes and their Applications 84 (1999) 313{ 342 337 Proof of Lemma 3. The proof of this lemma follows easily from the inequalities (5.10),(5.13) and (5.9) applied with q = 2 and 4. Proof of Theorem 2. Condition (H1) together with Lemmas 14 and 15 yields Aq(n)6Xq?1 m=1 Am(n)Aq?m(n) + CeqMq?2n Xn?1 r=0 (r + 1)q?2r: So that the sequence (Aq(n))q satises (5.2) with V~q(n) = CMq?2n Xn?1 r=0 (r + 1)q?2r: Hence it remains to check condition (5.3). This follows from the technical lemma and from the remark below (since the sequence (CMq?2r)q satises (H0)). Proof of Theorem 3. As in the proof of Theorem 2, it suces to note that the sequence V~ p(n):=max(cp; 2)Pni=1 R 1 0 [min(?1(u); n)]p?1Qpi (u) du satises (5.3). Proof of Lemma 1. Let g;f be some xed functions in I; then there exist u; v 2 Nand xi; x0j>0 such that g(y1; : : : ; yu) = gx1(y1) : : : gxu(yu) and f(y1; : : : ; yv) = gx01(y1) : : : gx0v(yv); where the functions (gx)x2R+ are dened as in (2.5). For xed x>0 and a>0, let fx(y) = 5y>x ? 5y6?x + ya ? xa + 15x?a<y<x + ya + xa ? 15?x<y<?x+a: Clearly, Lip(fx) = a?1 and jjfxjj1 = 1.

The above estimations then prove Corollary 1. 6. Proofs for the examples 6.1. Associated sequences Before adapting our moment inequalities to associated sequences we recall some basic lemmas. Lemma 17 (Newman, 1984). Let (Xn)n2N be an associated sequence. Let h; k; h1; k1 be some real-valued functions; such that the functions h1 ? h; h1 + h; k1 ? k; k1 + k are nondecreasing. Then jjCov(h(Xi; i 2 A); k(Xi; i 2 B))j6Cov(h1(Xi; i 2 A); k1(Xi; i 2 B)):

This implies the (;I;   )-weak dependence with   (h; k; u; v)=(u+v)2. Proof of Theorem 4. Let Cr; q(f) be the coecient associated to the sequence (f(Xi))i.

Gaussian sequences Lemma 8 is a consequence of the following. Lemma 19.

X (1=k) converges in distribution to X as k tends to 1. So that for bounded functions h and k, lim k!+1Cov(h(X (1=k)); k(X(1=k))) = Cov(h(X ); k(X)): Lemma 19 holds then taking the limit in the inequality (6.6) which is satised by X (1=k). 6.3.

Clearly, Cov(hA(X ); kB(X)) = Cov(hA(X ) ? hA(X (p)); kB(X)) +Cov(hA(X (p)); kB(X)?kB(X(p))) +Cov(hA(X (p)); kB(X(p))): (6.7) We now consider those three terms. First, note that hA(X (p)) is a measurable function of fi; i1 ? p<i<iu + pg and that kB(X (p)) is a measurable function of fi; j1?p<i<jv+pg. The sequence (i) is independent, so that Cov(hA(X (p)); kA(X(p))) = 0, as soon as iu + p6iu + r ? p, i.e. p6r=2. since h; k belong to the set L, we deduce that jCov(hA(X ) ? hA(X (p)); kB(X))j62jjkjj1EjhA(X ) ? hA(X (p))j 64ujjkjj1pLip(h);
