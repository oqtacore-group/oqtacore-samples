Keywords: Rnsenthal type inequality, law of large numbers, p -mixing #* -mixing random fields. Suppose that (B, (1 (1 ) is a separable Banach space with its dual B * , and (0, %, P) is a probability space. For any f'E B * and x E B, by fx we mean f ( x ) . For a B-valued random variable X on (0, 111, P), define 1) X I( = (E 1) X 11 P)l'P. Given two a-fields 9' in %, let #(F,Y) : -s u p { \ P(B I A ) -P ( B ) I ; A EZ B €9, P ( A ) # O \ , where Lp (,% B) denotes L/, space of .%measurable B-valued random variables, and Lp (q, B ) is denoted simply by Lp ( B ) or just Lp . Here and in the sequel measurability and integrability mean the strong measurability and strong integrability, respectively. Clearly, pm ( K Y ) < pB ( K .Y ) where R is the real space, and if B = W, then p~ (% 9 ) is the usual p-mixing coefficients. It is well known that pi (:F, 9")<2 (.F, i,). The following Property 1 tells us that it is also true for general Banach space B . Property 1 . 1 1 Given two 0-fields .% ,CP in "U and p, q > 1 with -+ -= 1, for any f P q Lp(:c B* ) and XE L,(F< B), we have I EfX -Ef EX 1<2#'/*(%9') 11 f 1 1 , 11 X 11 ,. Property 2. Suppose that f E Lp (.% B * ) and X E L, ( 9, B B) , where P q > 1 with 1/P + l /y = l . Then 2*2 I E f X -Ef EX 1 < 4 ~ : '(.%.SP) 11 f 11 ,1 1 X I /,. The proofs of Properties 1 and 2 are similar to those of Lemmas 1.2.7 and 1.2.8 of ref. [ I ] , so they are omitted here. Let d be a positive integer and, let N~ be the d-dimensional lattice equipped with the coordinatewise partial order, <.

Forany EN^, let ( n ) = /m E ~ ~ , m < n I , S , = S ( , ) , I n I = 1 ( n ) I = n 1 n2.e-nd and 11 n 11 denotes the Euclidean norm. Occasionally, n , k, n , etc. will also denote positive integers, the reader will not be confused from their context. For two nonempty disjoint sets S , T C N ~ ,w e define dist( S , T ) a s min 1 11 j -k 11 1 ; j E S , k E T 1 . Let a ( S ) be the a-field generated by /Xk ; k E S 1, and define a( T ) similarly. We define two mixing coefficients of Xg ; k f N~ 1 . For any real number s 1, define p;( ( s) = suppu ( a ( S ) , o ( T )) , where the supremum is taken over all pairs of sets S , T such that dist ( S , T ) 2 s , and define 9 " ( s ) similarly. Many limit results were obtained for real mixing random sequences in the past twenty years (cf. ref. [I ] and references therein) and for some real mixing random fields recently (cf. refs. [2-41). But, to the best of our knowledge, little is known of B-valued mixing random sequences or fields. The main purpose of this paper is to establish some moment inequalities just as the Rosenthal -type inequalities for block sums of p * -mixing or # * -mixing fields which are useful tools in studying the limit properties of these mixing random fields. The main results are stated in sec. 1. In sec. 2, we give some applications to weak laws of large numbers, Marcinkiewicz-Zygmund strong laws of large numbers and complete convergences. 1 Inequalities for moments of partial sums The first inequality seems simple but will be useful in proving our main inequalities. Theorem 1. Let :& 55 be two a-fields in OU, and Let p > 1 be a real number and p : = max 1 p~ (% Y 1, p~ fl 1 . Suppose that one of the following two conditons is satisfied : 2 2 1 1 (a) B * has the Radon-NikodYrn ( R-N) property and p? < l/4, where -+ -= 1, P 4 (b) B is reflexive ( i . e . , B"" = B ) and p < l . Then there exists u constant Cp = C ( p, p ) depending only on p and p such that E I/X II G CpE II X + Y II (1) holds for uny X E-L p( 9B, ) , Y E L p( 9B, ) wi th E X= EY = 0 . To prove Theorem 1, we need some lemmas. The first one is well known. Lemma 1. Giver! 1 < p < m, for any probability space ( 0, % P ) Lp (% B ) * = L, (Z B " ) i f and only i f B 1 1 * has the R-N property, where -+ -= 1 and Lp (z B ) * denotes the P 4 daul space of L p( .g,B ) . The following is the interpolation the~rem'~]. Lemma 2. Let 1< p, , q, < 03, i = 0,1, and let T be a linear operator mapping from Lpo + LqOi nto Lp,+ L,, wi th its restriction to Lpo( Lpl) being a continuous mapping from Lpo( Lp,) into L, (Lq ) . I f 0<8<1 and 0 1 Then T is a cor~tinuous mapping from L, into Lrl and

Given 1 < p < and two a-fields in 'Ill, if ,o : = max { pn (.y,F * ) , p~ (s,*@1 < 1 , then there exists C = C ( p , p ) such that the fol-Lowing tmpLicutzon holds. If XE Lp( 9B, ) , YE Lp( F*, B ) wi th EX = E Y = 0, then there is a ZE Lp(OU, B) such that X = E { Z l + j c ~ n d Y = E i Z l F * } I, I Z I I p < C ( I IXI I p + II YI Ip) . Proof. Let A be a linear operator defined by A ( ) = E E 1 . I F* 1 I F and let E ( . ) denote the linear operator of taking the expected value Ei. I . Clearly, II A -E I/L,(B)+L,(B)<~. /I A -E II L_(B)-.,._(U)<2 and (A -E) = Ak -E for each k 3 1 . First, we show that I1 A -E I1 L2(n)+L2(B<) P. (2) For any E € L2(.F*, B), by a well-known consequence of the Hahn-Banach theorem and Lemma 1, there exists a f * € L2($ B * ) with /I f * 1) 2 = 1 such that I I E ~ E I ~ q-E/~ I I , = ( I E [ E -E € I F ] 1 12 = E I C * ( E [ E -E ~ I F ] ) I = E I E [ E * ( ~ -E EI )F IT=] E I E * ( E-E EH = E E " E -E E * E E < ~ I I f * 1 1 2 1 1 ell2 = e l l 2 . It follows that for any EE L2(B), 11 (A -E ) ( f ) 11 2<p 1) E I 1 11 2<p 11 f 11 2, which implies (2) immediately. Now, for 1 < p < m , Lemma 2.2 implies 2 1 In particular, for centered € we have 11 A*€ 1 p<2>-1p2k ( ' 7 ) 11 E 11 for 1< p<2 and 11 A'C 2 2 /( p<21 -5pd //f (1 for 2Gp < 03. Since the estimate also holds for k = 0 and, by symmetry, also for A " ( E ) = E I E I E I . I~.F~* 1, c=z .z = g A k ( x -EI Y 1.71) + c(A*)*(Y -EIX I F* \). k = Il k = O is well defined and satisfies the asserted property by the triangle inequality and a simple computation. Proof of Theorem 1 . Suppose that (a) is satisfied. By a well-known consequence of Hahn-Banach theorem and Lemma 1, we get /I X /I , < /I X I/, + II Y /I p = Ef X + EgY, (3) where f E L , ( $7B, * ), g € Id,( x B * ) with (1 f 11 ,= 11 g (1 ,= 1. It follows from Property 2 that l l X i /, + 11 Y I l , = E ( f + g ) ( X + Y ) -E f Y -E g X < l l f + g I l , l I X + Y ~ I p + l E f Y 1 + 1 E g X 1

Since B is reflexive, B and B * have the R-N property, and (3) remains true. By assumption EX = E Y = 0, we can replace f and g in (3) by centered variables fl = f -Ef and gl= g -Eg, respectively. Noting B " " = B , by thedefinitionof e s ( . , .), wehave , 0 ~ + ( ~ 9 ' ) = ~ ~ ( aXnd. 3p)B -( z . 3 )=pB (9.9< 1. By Lemma 3, there exists h E L, ( %, B ), such that 11 h 11 , < 4 C ( q , p ) , E { h I % /= f,, Elh I Y /= g , . Theorefore Ef X + EgY = E { ( E [ h I 9 ] ) X \ + E{(E[h I g* ])YI = Eh(X + Y) <E( l lhl l . //X + Y Il /< /1 h ~ ~ , ~Y~l I pX<+4 C ( q , p ) l 1 X + YI I p . The proof is completed. The following is the Rosenthal type inequality for p " -mixing random fields. Theorem 2. Let B be of type p and let 1 Xk ; k E N~ /be a B-valued centered random field. Suppose that one of the following conditions is satisfied : (a) B has the R-N property and limp; ( r ) = 0, (b) B is reflexive and limp; ( r ) < 1. Then for any r > p , there exists a positive constant B, depending only on r , P and p i (. ) such that for any finite set sc Nd, Remark. If B is a p-uniformly smooth space, then it is reflexive and of type p . Proof. First, we prove that for any q > 1 there exists a positive constant D, = D ( q, p, p (. ) ) such that If (a) is satisfied, we can assume that ( p i (1) ) ;2 , , 1 1 1 1 9' < -, where -+ 7 = 1. Otherwise, we 4 Q 9 2 ~ 21 define J as the smallest integer for which ( p i (J) ); 9' < -.

Similarly, if (b) is satisfied, we can assume that p i (1) < 1. Now, suppose that 1 E, ; j E N~ 1 is a sequence of independent and identically dis-1 tributed random variables such that P(E, = 1) = P( E~ = -1) = -2 ' all j . 1 1 will also be independentof the x , .

Noting that for fixed { E, 1 the distance between the two sets { j ; E, = 11 and I€ s 1 ] ', El . = -1I is one, by Theorem 1 we have ExII Y + z I I ~ < c , { E ~ I IY I I ~ + E ~ I I Z I I ~ \ < C , E XYI I-z I I q .

Noting that I € S j € S there exists a positive constant c f l depending only on p and the space B such that we finish the proof of ( 5 ) . We first show (4) for B = R and p = 2. For any r>2, there exists k E N and l< < 2 such that r = 2kq, so (4) is equivalent to When k = 1 , noting that q/2<1, from ( 5 ) ( p = 2 ) we have . . Hence (6) holds when k = 1. When k 2 2 , assuming that (6) holds for any integer less than k , we will prove that (6) remains valid for R itself. From (5) ( ~ ' 2 ) and the hypothesis of induction, it follows that Suppose that 1 XI ; j E PId 1 is a field of independent random variables and Xj has the same distribution as X, for each j . Then by the Rosenthal inequality and the Marcinkiewicz-Zygmund inequality for independent random variables, it follows that b 1 <2(' D~~~C 6-l, ZEI X: -EX,2 I 2I-'q j E S 
No. 7 ROSENTHAL TYPE INEQUALITIES 741 Putting (8) into (7), we know that (6) remains valid for k . This proves (4) for B = R and p = 2. Now, suppose that r>p . Then where F, = /I X, II -E II X, I/P. It is easily seen that { en ; n E N~ j is a real ,n * -mixing field with p : ( r ) < p i ( r ) . If p<r<2p, by ( 5 ) (where p = 2 ) , it follows that The above inequality is obviously true for r = p . Now, suppose 7->2p. Since (4) is true for real fields (where p = 2 ) , it follows that Let 1 E ; n E N~ I be independent random variables such that for each n, En has the same distribution as En . Then where the last inequality is by the Rosenthal-type inequality for independent random variab~es'~]. It follows that The proof is completed. The Rosenthal-type inequality remains true for the maximal partial sums, if the random field is # * -mixing.

Let l< p < 2 and let B be a Banach space with B * having the R-N property.
