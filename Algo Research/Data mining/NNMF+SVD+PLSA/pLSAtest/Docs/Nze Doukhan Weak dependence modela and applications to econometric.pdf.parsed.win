Short running title: Weak dependence in econometrics Abstract In this paper we discuss weak dependence and mixing properties (Doukhan and Louhichi, 1999) of some popular models. We also develop some of their econometric applications. Autoregressive models, ARCH models and bilinear models are widely used in econometrics. More generally, stationary Markov modelling is often used. Bernoulli shifts also generate many useful stationary sequences, such as ARMA or ARCH(1) processes. For Volterra processes, mixing properties obtain given additional regularity assumptions on the distribution the innovations. We recall associated probability limit theorems and investigate the non-parametric estimation of those sequences. Key Words. Weak dependence, mixing, Markov sequences, Bernoulli shifts 2
1 Introduction Mixing is now systematically used in time series where martingale assumptions and results cannot be directly employed. Mixing has proved particularly useful in cases where nonlinearities appear, such as ARCH modelling in econometrics. This success relies on powerful limit theorems proved under mixing conditions (see Doukhan (1994), Rio (2000) or Doukhan (2002), among others). These limit results serve as basic tools for computation of the significance level and power of statistical tests. Mixing assumptions can be used in more general frameworks involving fading memory (asymptotic independence between functions of the past and the future of the process), such as Near Epoch Dependence (NED) of a mixing process. We recall here the mixing properties of some models used in econometrics. Simultaneously, we present a different approach to limit theorems when mixing does not hold (which really may occur, as shown in example (4.16) from Andrews (1984)). For the sake of simplicity, our exposition mainly focuses on one-dimensional time series. The paper is organized as follows. In order to provide deep econometric motivations, Section 2 exposes several situations where the various weak dependence conditions arise, and after some generic examples, we consider specific problems, including unit root problems, sieve bootstrap and semiparametric estimation problems in Sections 2.1, 2.2 and 2.4. Section 2.3 considers GMM estimation in which Doukhan and Louhichi (1999) weak dependence condition allows one to provide a complete proof of the results in Hall and Horowitz (1996). Indeed, the latter authors improperly claim a mixing property of their models in order to prove their consistency results. Finally, Section 2.6 considers nonparametric estimation problems. Section 3 makes precise the mathematical framework of weak dependence needed in the previous section. It describes some classical concepts of fading memory (mixing conditions, the association property) as well as the new weak dependence conditions introduced by Doukhan and Louhichi (1999). After this, Section 4 provides numerous classes of models commonly used in econometrics and finance and focuses on their weak dependence properties. Section 5 recalls some probabilistic limit theorems available in those cases. Extensions of Donsker's functional central limit theorem (CLT) and the functional CLT for the cumulative distribution function are discussed. Section 6 is devoted to functional estimation. Consistency as well as CLT's are discussed here. Proofs are given in Appendix A and Appendix B recalls the main probabilistic tools. Finally, we remark that the limit theorems of Section 3 and the asymptotic results for functional estimation in Section 6 are provided for very large classes of models (Sections 3 and 4). Hence, more general time series formulations such as those in Section 4 allow us to extend directly the classical results of Section 2. 2 Econometrics and dependence Time series analysis is a major part of econometrics. Here we provide several examples of interest in which it is essential to consider dependent structures instead of simple independence. In some situations, classical tools of weak dependence like mixing are useless. For instance, when bootstrap 3
techniques are used, no mixing conditions can be expected. Consider the following example concerning bootstrap: let a stationary autoregressive sequence be generated by an independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) sequence (n)n2ZZ: Xn = r(Xn?1) + n. (2.1) Standard nonparametric estimation techniques provide an estimate of the autoregression function r. Let br be a convenient estimator of r. Given data (X1, . . . ,Xn) from the sequence 2.1, another autoregressive process is defined by cXn = br(bXn?1) + bn. (2.2) The innovations bnare drawn according the empirical measure of the estimated residuals, bi = Xi ? br(Xi?1), 1 i n. No mixing assumption can be expected for the previous model (2.2): see (4.16) below. However, a new concept of fading memory can still be applied. Bickel and B?uhlmann (1999) set up such a new weak dependence condition in order to build critical bootstrap values for a linearity test in linear models. Doukhan and Louhichi (1999) have extended it in order to fit models such as positively dependent sequences, Markov chains (with or without topological assumptions), and Bernoulli shifts (see Definition 4.1). The Bernoulli shifts are defined in Assumption 1 of Hall and Horowitz (1996) and are used throughout that paper. The above mentioned weak dependence conditions yield standard results concerning convergence in distribution with a pn-normalization. Another application of these results concerns linearity tests in time series analysis. Rios (1996) considers a stationary functional autoregressive model (2.1) where r = L + C is the decomposition of the autoregression function into a sum of linear (L) and nonlinear (C) components. Local linearity of r is then tested via the null hypothesis H0 : Z ??r00(x)2 w(x) dx = 0 where the weight function w has compact support. Still another problem of interest is to test the independence of the innovations (n)n2ZZ in a regression model Xn = aYn + n. This can be performed using the Durbin-Watson statistic. The latter can be written as a continuous functional of the Donsker line of the sequence (n)n2ZZ. 2.1 Unit root tests Consider a stationary autoregressive sequence (Xn)n2ZZ generated by an i.i.d. sequence (n)n2ZZ, Xn = aXn?1 + n. A classical problem is to test whether there is a unit root (that is a = 1). In the specific context of aggregate time series, the assumption of white noise innovations seems to be rather strong. Phillips (1987) develops unit root tests for mixing and heterogeneously distributed innovations. The ordinary 4
least square estimate ba is shown to be a continuous functional of the Donsker line of the sequence (n)n2ZZ. As an application of the functional central limit theorem, Phillips shows that a unit root test can be based on the fact that under the null hypothesis H0 : a = 1, n (ba ? 1) D ???! n!1 1 2 R 1 0 W2 t dt  W2 1 ? 22! where W denotes the standard Brownian motion and 2 = P1?1 Cov(0, k). The author works with stationary strong mixing sequences, and conditions under which the functional CLT result holds true are reported in Section 5.1. This result can be obtained under a weak dependent context detailed in Section 4. The conditions for which Donsker's theorems hold are described in Section 5.1. This example, as the author suggests, can be generalized to error sequences (n)n2ZZ that allow for heteroskedasticity. See also Mills (1999) for a discussion of the Dickey-Fuller unit root test in autoregressive models when errors fluctuate about a non zero mean. 2.2 Parametric problems Generalized method of moments (GMM) estimation procedures involve an estimate bn, which is a solution of the arg-min problem Jn(bn) = min2Jn(), where Jn() =  1nXn i=1 g(Xi, )!0  1n Xn i=1 g(Xi, )!. (2.3) Here IRd is a finite dimensional parameter set, and g(-, -) is a given function such that IE0g(X1, 0) = 0, where 0 is the true parameter point. In the time series context, the positive semi-definite matrix is often replaced (see Hall and Horowitz, 1996, equation (3.2)) by an asymptotically optimal weight matrix estimate n() = 1n Xn i=1 g(Xi, )g(Xi, )0 + Xj=1 H(Xi,Xi+j , ), H(x, y, ) = g(x, )g(y, )0 + g(y, )g(x, )0, and is such that IEg(Xi, )g(Xj , )0 = 0 if |i ? j| > . The statistic to test H0 : = 0 is Jn() = Kn(bn)0Kn(bn), where Kn() = p1nn() 12 Pni=1 g(Xi, ) (the square root of a symmetric positive matrix is uniquely defined). 2.2.1 Block bootstrap A bootstrap procedure allows one to estimate the limit distribution of an estimate. We describe block-bootstrap procedure which is adapted to the times series (Xi)i2IN. Let b = b (n) and l = l (n) denote the number and the length of the blocks. Then bl = n and the block j is (eX(j?1)l+1, . . . , eXjl) (see K?unsch, 1989). In this construction, a suitable form of eXk is bHbk, bk?1, . . . , bk?l+1, 0, . . . if the process Xk = H(k, k?1, . . .) is a Bernoulli shift as defined in Section 4.3. Here bHand bk are obtained through filtering and estimation procedures in the simple case of a linear process (H(z0, z1, . . .) = Pk akzk, see 5
Section 2.3); in the general setting, one needs to develop additional estimation procedures. In order to describe the asymptotic properties of such processes one needs to know the limiting asymptotic behaviour of Bernoulli shifts. 2.2.2 Conditional bootstrap A simple local conditional bootstrap is investigated by Ango Nze, B?uhlmann and Doukhan (2002). In the above paper, it is shown that asymptotic properties can be obtained using the same weak dependence techniques. The following CLT holds under standard mixing assumptions: Tn() = pn ?1 n bn ? D ???! n!1 Nd(0, Id), (2.4) where the diagonal matrix n has d entries. GMM techniques naturally involve an unknown covariance matrix. In order to estimate such limiting distributions it is natural to use bootstrap techniques. 2.3 Bootstrapping critical values for GMM estimators Let (?Xi )1in denote a block-bootstrap sample and let g(x, ) = g (x, ) ? IEg x, bn. The expectation is taken with respect to the bootstrap distribution. The GMM estimate bnsolves the arg-min problem Jn() =  1nXn i=1 g(Xi , )!0  1n Xn i=1 g(Xi , )! (2.5) if the matrix is known. Hall and Horowitz (1996) make the erroneous statement that such Bernoulli shifts are strong mixing. However, the procedure used by Hall and Horowitz makes the bootstrap work. The weak dependence condition as defined in Doukhan and Louhichi (1999) allows us to rigorously prove the consistency of Hall and Horowitz procedures. More precisely, if Xn = h(n, n?1, . . .) for some i.i.d. sequence (i)i2ZZ, their Assumption 1 is1 IEkh(n, n?1, . . .) ? h(n, n?1, . . . , n?m, 0, 0, . . .)k e?dm d . This condition holds for linear processes and it is claimed to imply geometric strong mixing by the authors. Simple example (4.16) proves that this does not hold in general. This condition, however, does imply weak dependence in Doukhan and Louhichi (1999). Consequently, a tail inequality for sums of functions of the sequence n = f(Xn, ) can be derived. It is the main tool to prove the validity of the bootstrap in this dependent setting. The above procedure can be used for testing the null hypothesis H0 : = 0 against the bilateral alternative. The studentized statistic Tn () described in (2.4) and the critical value Qthen satisfy the relation that, under H0 IP(|Tn ()| > Q) = + O(1/n) . 1The function h takes its values in Lx ? 1 space equipped with a norm k - k. The assumption is missing the symbol of mathematical expectation IE, as in Andrews (2002). 6
Hall and Horowitz show that the bootstrap studentized statistic Tn() = pn n?1 bn? bnand the above mentioned statistic Tn () have close laws, in the sense that IPsup z2IR |IP(Tn() z) ? IP(Tn() z)| > n?a= o ??n?a, (2.6) for a relevant integer 2a, with a 1 + , and the range of 2 [0, 1] is formulated according to the dependence assumptions prescribed. This relation comes from an Edgeworth development. It yields an improved acceptation rule for the test of H0 : IP(|Tn ()| > Q) = + O??n?1?. Andrews (2002) points out that a direct computation of the bootstrap critical value Qis a hard problem, and that the common estimating procedure, which is based upon B bootstrapped, independent copies (from the law of large numbers, it follows that Q(B) P ????! B!1 Q) is also difficult to implement. Indeed, the computations involve the minimization of B nonlinear functionals. A numerical improvement is brought in Andrews' paper. A bootstrap estimator bn,k is computed by applying the Newton-Raphson algorithm. The initial value is bn,0 = bn and k iterations are made (k 3). A bootstrap studentized statistic T n,k is now available, for which the computation of the critical bootstrap values Q(B) is much easier, since the problem is linear. The method is claimed to be as accurate as that one discussed by Hall and Horowitz. In fact, the author states a similar result to (2.6) with respect to IPT n,k() zand IP(Tn() z). The assumptions are those of Hall and Horowitz. Therefore, the above mentioned Assumption 1 must also be read in the sense of the comments we have already made about Hall and Horowitz' paper. For the sake of completeness we present a corrected version of Lemma 1 in Hall and Horowitz (1996) proven in Section 9.4. Lemma 2.1 Let (n) be a stationary  1?weakly dependent (see Definition 3.4) sequence with IEn = 0 such that r = O(e?ar) for some a > 0, as r " 1, and IP(|1| z) = O??|z|?33, as |z| ! 1. Then2 Rn = n?1Pni=1 i satisfies lim n!1nIP|Rn| > n?2+5 = 0. Following precisely the same steps as in Hall and Horowitz (1996), we thus prove, by only replacing their Lemma 1 by Lemma 2.1, that bootstrapping critical values for GMM estimators are valid. Now Theorems 1, 2 and 3 in Hall and Horowitz (1996) are rigorously proven. A paper on this topic by the first author is in preparation, in order to provide sharper results; for instance, the exponent 33 in the previous lemma is unnatural and it can be changed. 2.4 Sieve bootstrap Bickel and B?uhlmann (1999) tackle the problem of the 'sieve bootstrap' for a one sided linear process Xn ? ? = 0 + 1Xt=1 atn?t (2.7) 2Here r is a dependence coefficient and it is not related to a statistical parameter denoted and estimated by bn. 7
where (n) is a sequence of i.i.d. random variables (r.v.'s) with IE0 = 0 and the density function f, and whereP1t=1 |at| < 1 and ? = IEXn. Under the assumption that the function (z) = 1+P1t=1 atzt has no root in the closed unit circle, the process (2.7) admits an AR(1) representation (Xn ? ?) + 1Xt=1 bt(Xn?t ? ?) = n (2.8) with P1t=1 |bt| < 1. The latter process (2.8) is fitted with an autoregressive process of finite order p(n) (p(n)/n ! 0, p(n) ! 1). Using estimated residuals, the resampling (i.i.d.) innovation process (n)n2ZZ is constructed by smoothing the empirical process based on those residuals by a kernel density estimate of the density f. Finally, the smoothed sieve bootstrap sample (Xn)n2ZZ is defined by resampling the AR(p(n)) process from innovations (n)n2ZZ: (Xn? ?X) + pX(n) t=1 bt(Xn?t ? ?X) = n(2.9) The purpose of the paper was to carry over a weak dependence property (here strong mixing) of the initial sequence (Xn)n2ZZ to the sieve processes (Xn)n2ZZ (a classic and a smoothed version were examined in the paper). The goal is unrealistic for the classic bootstrap sample, since the distribution of the bootstrapped innovations is discrete. Proving a mixing property for the smoothed sieve bootstrap sample eludes the efforts of the authors. In the latter case, it nevertheless appears that limit theorems can be proven by another method. It consists of using the following property: |Cov (g1 (X?d1+1, . . . ,X0) , g2 (Xk, . . . ,Xk+d2?1)) | 4kg1k1kg2k1k; Cd1 , Cd2, (2.10) with d1, d2 2 IN and for smooth functions g1, g2 belonging to the classes Cd1 and Cd2 (see equation (3.1) for the definition of the class Cd and some examples). The new dependence coefficient is less than the strongly mixing coefficient. Bickel and B?uhlmann (1999) cannot prove that the sieve sequence (Xn) is strongly mixing. A weak dependence condition is now defined by the coefficient. The latter authors prove that it is satisfied by both this sequence and a smooth version of the resampled innovations. For instance, Bickel and B?uhlmann prove that if the sequence (Xn)n2ZZ satisfies some regularity conditions ensuring that k = O(k?) (recall that k k), then the sieve bootstrap process (Xn)n2ZZ satisfies a mixing condition with a polynomial rate (k; Cd1 ,Dd2) = O??k?Lfor relevant classes Cd1 ,Dd2 and a positive constant L. See Theorem 3.2. on page 422 in Bickel and B?uhlmann (1999) for more details. 2.5 A Semi-parametric estimation problem We follow the presentation in Robinson (1989). He considers an economic variable observable at time n which is an R ? 1 vector of r.v.'s (Wn)n2ZZ. We observe Wn at time n = 1 ? P, 2 ? P, . . . , T where P is nonnegative and T large. Hypotheses of economic interest often involve a subset Xn = B(W0n, . . . ,W0 n?P ) of the array (W0n, . . . ,W0 n?P )0; for this B is a J ? (PR) matrix formed from the PR?rowed identity matrix IPR by omitting PR ? J rows (which means that in B, PR ? J elements of Wn, . . . ,Wn?P are deleted). Thus, in B, elements of Wn,Wn?1, . . . ,Wn?P which are not 8
in Xn are deleted, and Xn can have elements in common with Xn+P?1, . . . ,Xn+1,Xn?1, . . . ,Xn?P . Let Xn = (Y 0n,Z0n)0, where Yn and Zn are K ? 1 and L ? 1 vectors (K + L = J). The problem of interest is to test the hypothesis IE(Yn|Zn) = 0 against the alternative IE(Yn|Zn) 6= 0. This null hypothesis is written in the form = RIRL H(z, z)f2(z)dz = 0 for M = 0 and = RIRL H(z, z) ??f(z), f(1)(z)0, . . . , f(M)(z)00 f(z)dz = 0 for some M > 0 and some function H(z, z) defined as H(z1, z2) = RIRK?IRK G(x1, x2)dF(y1|z1)dF(y2|z2) for some convenient function G and where F(A|z) = IP(Yn 2 A|Zn = z) for any Borel set A of IRK and z 2 IRL and x1 = (y01, z01)0 and x2 = (y02, z02)0. Here f(j)(z) denotes the vector of j?partial derivatives of f. An example of this framework is given by Xn = (Y 0n,Z0n)0, where Yn = (tn, s0n)0 and Zn = vn. The regression model tn = 0(sn ? IEnsn) + 0IEnsn + un (2.11) is of common use in econometrics. Here sn, tn, vn are respectively scalars, p ? 1 and q ? 1; they are observable random sequences while the innovation process (un) is centered and unobservable, so that IE(un|sn, tn) = 0; we denote IEn(-) = IE(-|vn). In the case of a weakly dependent and stationary innovation process, Robinson (1989) considers the hypothesis H0 : = 0. In this case, the hypothesis can be written as before and Robinson calculates = where K = p + 1, L = 1, M = 0 and G(x1, x2) = (t1 ? t2)s1(v1) for some function : IRq ! IR (usually 1). Robinson considers the statistics ?= nb0b?1bconstructed from the n?sample (X1, . . . ,Xn). Here, b= 1 n2hL Pni,j=1 G(Xi,Xj)k(Zi ?Zj/h) is a U?statistics and bis the natural estimator of the covariance matrix of b. One such estimate is b= 1n Pni=1 cic0i. Tapered versions might be preferred (see formula (2.21) of Robinson, 1989), here ci = Pnj=1 di,j +dj,i with di,j = G(Xi,Xj)k(Zi?Zj)/h, where k(z) = h?L ??k(z), h?1k(1)(z)0, . . . , h?Mk(M)(z)0. Under ?mixing assumptions, Robinson proves that the above estimates are pn?consistent and satisfy a CLT. Under a natural ?mixing condition, Robinson proves in fact that the statisticbhas asymptotically a 2?distribution if j = O(j?b) where b > ?/(? ? 2) under the moment assumption supi,j IE|G(Xi,Xj)|? < 1. The ?mixing assumption allows to compare the joint distribution of the initial sequence with respect to a sequence of r.v.'s with independent blocks. This reconstruction is due to Berbee's coupling lemma, no matter how big the size of the blocks may be. Yoshihara (1976) derives a covariance inequality that fits to U?statistics. A way to get rid of ?mixing conditions is to consider an independent realization ?X1, . . . , ?Xn of the trajectory X1, . . . ,Xn. Now a simpler estimator of is given by e= 1 n2hL Xn i,j=1G(Xi, ?Xj)k Zi ? ? Zj h !. The asymptotic behaviour of this expression is easy to derive under alternative weak dependence conditions by using our results because e= 1 hL Pni=1Wn,h(Xj) is the numerator of a Nadaraya-Watson kernel for the regression estimation problem IE(s1(t1 ? t)|v1 = z) in the special case of the previous example. In fact this trick avoids the corresponding coupling construction for U?statistics. 9
2.6 Non-parametric problems For a stationary process (Zt)t2ZZ with Zt = (Xt, Yt), an important quantity is the regression function r(x) = IE(Y0|X0 = x). Various methods to fit such a function have been developed. Nadaraya-Watson kernel estimates are very popular; see Rosenblatt (1993), Prakasa-Rao (1983), or Robinson (1983), for instance. Let K be some kernel function that integrates to 1, Lipschitzian and with compact support. Among other problems, one may wish to estimate the volatility of financial times series, v(x) = Var (Xt|Xt?1 = x). The question enters the general framework since v(x) = v2(x) ? v21(x), where vj(x) = IE(Xj1|X0 = x). Another important problem of econometric interest is to estimate the marginal density f of a stationary sample. Density kernel estimators built on K are available. Density and regression functions of derivatives can also be estimated by using analogous procedures. Finally, conditional quantiles are linked to the conditional distribution F(y | x) = IP(X1 y|X0 = x). More precisely, we denote by q(t|x) = inf {y; F(y | x) > t} the generalized (right-continuous, with left-limits) inverse of the monotone function y 7! F(y | x). Consistent estimators of the conditional regression IE(Yt(y)|Xt = x), where Yt(y) = 1IXt+1y, provide information on the previous conditional quantiles. 3 Weak Dependence Conditions Various generalizations of independence have been introduced in order to answer the econometric questions discussed in Section 2. The martingale setting was the first extension of the independence framework (Hall and Heyde, 1980); weakening martingale conditions yields mixingales. Martingale conditions are written in terms of conditional expectations and they seem to be quite restrictive in econometric practice. Near epoch dependence is a more flexible tool for modeling fading memory. The ergodic theorem is the first limit theorem proven for dependent sequences. Another point of view is given by the mixing properties of stationary sequences in the sense of ergodic theory: uniform versions of such properties are the forthcoming mixing properties. Those conditions are also based on independence properties of the underlying generated ?algebras. They are also difficult to check (see Doukhan, 1994). Our aim is to promote the weak dependence properties which will be seen to be much easier to prove. 3.1 Mixing Let (,A, IP) be a probability space and let U, V be two sub -algebras of A, various measures of dependence between U and V have been introduced; among them we recall (U, V) = sup{|IP(U \ V ) ? IP(U)IP(V )|;U 2 U, V 2 V}, (U, V) = IEsup{|IP(V |U) ? IP(V )|; V 2 V}, (U, V) = sup{|Corr(u, v)|; u 2 IL2(U), v 2 IL2(V)}, (U, V) = sup{|IP(V |U) ? IP(V )|;U 2 U, V 2 V, IP(U) > 0}. 10
The above coefficients are, respectively, Rosenblatt (1956)'s strong mixing coefficient (U, V), Wolkonski and Rozanov (1959)' absolute regularity coefficient (U, V), Kolmogorov and Rozanov (1960)' maximal correlation coefficient (U, V), and Ibragimov (1962)'s uniform mixing coefficient (U, V). Let X = (Xn)n2ZZ be a discrete time stationary process. We denote XA = {Xt; t 2 A} the A-marginal of X with A ZZ. Finally, (Z) will denote the -algebra generated by a r.v. Z. For any coefficient previously defined, say c(., .), we shall call the process X a c-mixing process if limk!1 cX,k = 0, where cX,k = c((X]?1,0]), (X[k,+1[). The following relations hold: ? mixing ) ? mixing ) ? mixing, and ? mixing ) ? mixing ) ? mixing and no reverse implication holds in general. See Doukhan (1994) for more information. 3.2 Mixingales and Near Epoch Dependence Let X = (Xn)n2ZZ be a real-valued process. We let kXnkp = (IE(|Xn|p))1/p (1 p < 1). Definition 3.1 (Mc Leish (1975), Andrews (1988)) . Let p 1 and let (Fn)n2ZZ be an increasing sequence of -algebras. The sequence (Xn,Fn)n2ZZ is called an ILp-mixingale if there exist nonnegative sequences (cn)n2ZZ and ( (n))n2ZZ such that  (n) ?! 0 as n ! 1 and for all integers n 2 ZZ, k 0, kXn ? IE(Xn | Fn+k) kp cn  (k + 1) , (3.12) kIE(Xn | Fn?k) kp cn  (k) . (3.13) This property of fading memory is easier to handle than the martingale condition. A more general concept is the near epoch dependence (NED) on a mixing process. Its definition can be found in Billingsley (1968) who considered functions of ?mixing processes. Definition 3.2 (P?otscher and Prucha (1991)) . Let p 1. We consider a c-mixing process (Vn)n2ZZ . For any integers i j, set Fj i = (Vi, . . . , Vj) . The sequence (Xn,Fn)n2ZZ is called an ILp-NED process on the c-mixing process (Vn)n2ZZ if there exist nonnegative sequences (cn)n2ZZ and ( (n))n2ZZ such that  (n) ?! 0 as n ! 1 and for all integers n 2 ZZ, k 0, Xn ? IEXn | Fn+k n?k p cn  (k) . This approach is developed in details in P?otscher and Prucha (1991). Functions of MA(1) processes can be handled using NED concept. For instance, limit theorems can be deduced for sums of such Functions of MA(1) processes. These previous definitions translate the fact that a k-period - ahead in the first case, both ahead and backwards in the second definition - projection is convergent to the unconditional mean. They are known to be satisfied by a wide class of models. For example, martingale differences can be described as IL1-mixingale sequences, and linear processes with martingale difference innovations as well. 11
3.3 Association The notion of association was introduced independently by Esary, Proschan and Walkup (1967) and Fortuin, Kastelyn and Ginibre (1971). The motivations of those authors were radically different since the first ones were working in reliability theory and the others in mechanical statistics, and their condition is known as FKG inequality. Definition 3.3 The sequence (Xt)t2ZZ is associated, if for all coordinatewise increasing real-valued functions h and k, Cov(h(Xt, t 2 A), k(Xt, t 2 B)) 0 for all finite disjoint subsets A and B of ZZ and IE??h(Xt, t 2 A)2 + k(Xt, t 2 B)2< 1. This extends the positive correlation assumption to model the notion that two stochastic processes have a tendency to evolve in a similar way. This definition is deeper than the simple positive correlatedness. Besides the evident fact that it does not assume that the variances exist, one can easily construct orthogonal (hence positively correlated) sequences that do not have the association property. An important difference between the above conditions is that its uncorrelatedness implies independence of an associated sequence (Newman, 1984). Let, for instance, (k, k) be independent and i.i.d. N(0, 1) sequences. Then the sequence (Xn)n2ZZ defined by Xk = k(k ? k?1) is neither correlated nor independent, hence it is not an associated sequence. Heredity of association only holds under monotonic transformations. This unpleasant restriction will disappear under the assumption of weak dependence. The above property of associated sequences was a guideline for the forthcoming definition of weak dependence. It contains the idea that weakly correlated associated sequences are also 'weakly dependent'. Very explicit inequality (9.17) proves that this idea makes sense. On the opposite side, negatively associated sequences of r.v.'s are defined by a similar relation as the aforementioned covariance inequality, except for the sign of this inequality. Shao (2000) provides a lucid summary of this type of association. Then he points out a crucial property of domination by comparable independent sequences. This property breaks the seemingly parallel definitions of positively and negatively associated sequences. We shall develop this idea further. 3.4 Weak dependence Here we shall make more explicit the asymptotic independence between 'past' and 'future'. Roughly speaking, for convenient functions h and k, we shall assume that Cov (h('past'), k('future')) is small when the distance between the 'past' and the 'future' is sufficiently large. Define by IL1 the union of the sets ILu of numerical bounded measurable functions on some Euclidean space IRu (u 2 IN) and k.k1 the corresponding uniform norm. We define the Lipschitz modulus of a function h : IRu ! IR byLip(h) = sup x6=y |h(x) ? h(y)| kx ? yk1 , where k(z1, . . . , zu)k1 = |z1| + - - - + |zu|, 12
if x = (z1, . . . , zu) . Consider the class L = {h 2 IL1; khk1 1, Lip(h) < 1}. (3.14) Definition 3.4 (Doukhan and Louhichi (1999)) . A sequence (Xn)n2ZZ is called (,L,  )-weak dependent if there exists a sequence = (r)r2IN decreasing to zero at infinity, and a function   with arguments (h, k, u, v) 2 L2 ?IN2 such that for any u-tuple (i1, . . . , iu) and any v-tuple (j1, . . . , jv) with i1 - - - iu < iu + r j1 - - - jv, one has |Cov(h(Xi1 , . . . ,Xiu), k(Xj1 , . . . ,Xjv ))|  (h, k, u, v)r (3.15) if the functions h and k are defined respectively on IRu and on IRv. Notice that the sequence depends both on the class L and on the function  . The function   can in fact depend on all its arguments, contrary to the case of bounded mixing sequences. This definition is hereditary through images by convenient functions. The examples of interest to follow involve the function  1(h, k, u, v) = uLip(h)+vLip(k),  01(h, k, u, v) = vLip(k),  2(h, k, u, v) = uvLip(h)Lip(k) and  02(h, k, u, v) = vLip(h)Lip(k). For example, proving that aMA(1) process, Xn = Pkakn?k based on a i.i.d. sequence such that IE|0| < 1andPk |ak| < 1 is  01?weakly dependent with r = IE|0|Pk>r |ak| is based on the decomposition Xn = Xn + Xn with Xn = Pk<r akn?k. In this case, assuming for simplicity that v = 1 and j1 = n, we have3 |Cov(h('past'), k(Xn))| =Cov(h('past'), k(Xn) ? k(Xn))Lip(h)IE|Xn| 4 Models. Dependence properties 4.1 Markovian Models 4.1.1 Models with a Markovian representation Let (n)n2ZZ be a real valued i.i.d. sequence and let M be some function. We consider vector valued models driven by the equation Xn = M(Xn?1, . . . ,Xn?p, n). In order to justify the title of this section, note that the vector valued sequence (X(p) n )n2ZZ, where X(p) n = (Xn?1, . . . ,Xn?p), is Markovian. Using Kallenberg (1997)'s Proposition 7.6 proves that any Markov process has such a representation. 3Thanks to an anonymous referee, we prove that NED implies our weak dependence through the following inequalities. For simplicity, write h = h(Xi1 , . . . ,Xiu), k = k(Xj1 , . . . ,Xjv ), then the Cauchy Schwarz inequality gives |Cov(h(Xi1 , . . . ,Xiu), k(Xj1 , . . . ,Xjv ))| = |IE(h, k ? IEk(|Fiu)| qIEh2IE?? IE(k ? IEk|Fiu)2and the last expression can be bounded using the IL2-mixingale property of IL2-NED sequences. Clearly, this implication is not an equivalence between both notions. This is an open question whether or not these notions are equivalent. 13
Under 'reasonable' assumptions (described below) such models can be rewritten as ergodic Markov chains (see Meyn and Tweedie (1993) or Tjostheim (1990)). Thus, the stationarity assumption is reachable. An interesting class is given by Xn = R(Xn?1, . . . ,Xn?p, n) + S(Xn?1, . . . ,Xn?p)n where (n)n2ZZ and (n)n2ZZ are two mutually independent i.i.d. sequences and the function S satisfies S(x1, . . . , xp) s > 0 for some s 2 IR, and any real numbers x1, . . . , xp and the functions R and S essentially satisfy contraction assumptions (see Doukhan (1994), Ango Nze (1995), (1998) or Duflo (1990) for developments). For instance, ARMA(p, q) processes Yn =Xp i=1 aiYn?i + n + Xq j=1 bjn?j , have such a Markov representation in the case when the roots of the polynomial Pqj=1 bjxj lie outside the unit disk. Indeed, Xn = (Yn, Yn,n+1 . . . , Yn,n+`?1), where ` = max{p, q + 1} and Yn,j = IE[Yj | Yi : i n] is a Markov process. See Mokkadem (1990). A further example is that of bilinear models4 which are popular in econometrics Xn = (a + bn?2)Xn?2 + (c + dn?1)Xn?1 + n. Examples of such models are also doubly stochastic autoregressive processes: Xn = nXn?1 + n. Econometricians have introduced Generalized ARCH-GARCH processes: Xn = r(Xn?1, . . . ,Xn?p) + s(Xn?1, . . . ,Xn?p)n in order to model conditional variances (interpreted as an asset volatility in finance theory for instance) that change over time ( see Bollerslev (1986) for further references). These models are known to satisfy the NED property of definition (3.2). Note that functional autoregressive models correspond to constant functions s (see Bollerslev (1986)). Moreover, threshold models are those for which r is linear on a partition of the space into polygonal regions. For example, Petruccelli and Woolford (1984) study threshold autoregressive models such as Xn = aX+n?1 + bX?n?1 + n, where x+ = max (x, 0) and x? = min (x, 0) . This model is ergodic if a < 1, b < 1 and ab < 1 and has geometric rates of convergence in total variation to the stationary limit if the centered sequence (n) has finite exponential moment and its distribution has a density with respect to Lebesgue measure. If for instance (a, b) = ( 12 ,?2), the function r(x) = ax+ + bx? is relevant, but it is not a contraction. 4Further technical details on this topic are provided by Granger and Andersen (1978), among other references. 14
ARCH or GARCH models are those with non constant functions s, such as square roots of nonnegative polynomials with degree 2, viz Xn = aXn?1 + ??b2 + c2X2 n?11/2 n, with |a|+|c| < 1. Vector valued versions of such models can also be described. They include GARCHmodels. The following example of a Markovian non-mixing sequence is given in Andrews (1984) and Rosenblatt (1985). This is the (Markov) AR(1)-process with binomial innovations (IP(0 = 0) = IP(0 = 1) = 12 ): Xn = 12(Xn?1 + n). (4.16) This is also the Bernoulli shift Xn = H(n, n?1, . . .) with H(x) = P1k=0 2?(k+1)xk. Full definitions of Bernoulli shifts will be given in Section 4.3. This model has stationary uniform distribution on the interval [0, 1] but it satisfies no mixing condition. Indeed, the innovations j (j n) are the digits of the dyadic expansion of Xn, hence, Xk is a deterministic function of Xn for k n. An extension of this model to innovations taking p different values is immediate; for this, one can use the numeration in basis p. The process Xn = 0.nn?1 - - - is the solution of the recurrence equation Xn = 1p (Xn?1 + n) if the innovations are uniform on {0, 1, . . . , p ? 1}. 4.1.2 Weak dependence properties Lipschitzian models (see Duflo (1990)) are multivariate Markov models, defined recursively through Xn = M(Xn?1, n) and the assumptions that IEkM(x, n) ?M(y, n)kS akx ? ykS and IEkM(0, n)kS < 1, for some 0 a < 1 and S 1. Here, the IRp-space where the process lives is equipped with some - not necessarily Euclidean - norm k -k. Duflo (1990) introduces the concept of stability of such Markov chains. She proves their geometric stability. That is, denoting n (X0) to precise the initial state X0, there exists some c 2 [0, 1[ such that for any x, y 2 IRp kn (x) ? n (y) k cnkx ? yk. In the particular case where X00s distribution is the stationary probability measure, kn (x) ? n (X0) k cnkx ? X0k. Using those results, Doukhan and Louhichi (1999) deduce (,L,  01)-weak dependence. In fact, under the assumptions below, one has r = O(ar) and  01(h, k, u, v) = vLipk. Here neither stationarity is required nor any further regularity assumption on the sequence of innovations. Such contraction properties are also used by P?otscher and Prucha (1991). More general AR(p) nonlinear models, Xn = M(Xn?1, . . . ,Xn?p; n), have the same properties, if for example, IE|M(0; n)| < 1 and, for some constants aj 0, 1 j p with Ppj=1 aj < 1, IE|M(x1, . . . , xp; n) ?M(y1, . . . , yp; n)| Xp j=1 aj |xj ? yj |. 15
The more recent paper by Diaconis and Friedmann (1999) provides a wide range of examples in this spirit. Alsmeyer and Fuh (2001) give conditions for arithmetic decay of the weak dependence coefficient sequence. Both papers study iterated random sequencesMn = F ("n,Mn?1) for independent sequences ("n) and some F, measurable and Lispschitz in the second variable. The process (Mn) takes values in a complete separable metric space (E, d) and forms a Markov chain. Under the assumption of existence of the unique invariant distribution , both papers prove, using different methods, that e d (IP(Mn 2 - | M0 = x) , (.)) Ax (n + 1)?p if for some x0 2 E and p > 0 IElogp+1 (1 + Lip (F ("1, .))) < 1 and IElogp+1 (1 + d (F ("1, x0) , x0)) < 1. (4.17) The distance e d is the Prohorov metric associated with d. 4.1.3 Mixing properties Mixing properties of the models with a Markovian representation, Xn = M(Xn?1, . . . ,Xn?p, n), are described in Meyn and Tweedie (1993). The above models are ergodic under suitable assumptions on 0's distribution. Assume that IE|0| < 1 and assume the existence of an almost surely non-vanishing density f for 0's law. Then, under contraction assumptions on the function M, one can prove that, under the invariant initial distribution, n = O(n?b) or n = O(e?bn). If M(Xn?1, . . . ,Xn?p, n) = R(Xn?1, . . . ,Xn?p) + n, then the second relation holds if, for example, |R(x1, . . . , xp)| A + a1|x1| + - - - + ap|xp| with a1 + - - - + ap < 1, (4.18) and R is continuous (it is enough that R be continuous out of a null set; for example, a piecewise continuous function R is relevant, as in the above mentioned threshold model by Petruccelli and Woolford (1984). See Doukhan (1994) for more details). In fact, Davydov (1973) proved that Harris recurrent Markov chains are ergodic and -mixing when stationary; moreover, denoting by ? the stationary distribution of the Markov chain Xn, by P the transition probability kernel and by k - kTV the norm in total variation, one has that: n = Z kPn(x, -) ? ?kTV ?(dx). Returning to the more specific models introduced before, Ango Nze (1995) proves that (4.18) implies the -mixing property under the assumption that 0's distribution has a density with respect to Lebesgue measure. The mixing coefficients decrease at a geometric rate. If, moreover, p = 1 in the preceding (functional AR(1)) model, he proves (see also Doukhan (1994)) that, under the previous assumptions on the white noise (n), ? limn!1 n = 0 if |R(x)| |x|?IE|0|?for some > 0, x is large enough and R is locally bounded. ? n = O(n?b) if |R(x)| |x| ? c|x| b 1+b + A for some constants c,A > 0 and any real number x. The function R is continuous. A more general result is obtained in Ango Nze (1998) if IE|0|S < 1. 16
Veretennikov (1999) improves on the previous hyperbolic mixing decay assumptions. Under a local Do?eblin condition, (implied by the above absolute continuity assumptions on 0's distribution) he proves that n = O(n?b) if b < S/2 ? 1 where S > 4 satisfies IE|0|S < 1. The existence of the stationary distribution is proven under the relaxed condition S 2. Improved results are provided in Fort and Moulines (2002) ; they are clarified by Jarner and Tweedie (2002) where constants are explicitly given. ? n = O(e?bn) if |R(x)| B|x| + A for some constants B < e?b and A > 0 and any real number x. The function R is continuous. If the innovations have a finite exponential moment, IEec|0| < 1, Mokkadem (1990) proves that the assumptions |R(x)| |x| ? for some > 0 and |x| big enough ensure an analogous result: the mixing sequence (n) decays at a exponential rate. ? n = O(e?bn) if R(x) is a bounded function, continuous outside a null set, and 0's law is not orthogonal to Lebesgue measure; moreover, the stationarity is no longer required. Unfortunately, this drastic boundedness condition excludes, for example, the linear autoregressive processes. The results above provide (upper) bounds for the mixing coefficients. It is a much harder problem to derive both upper and lower bounds of the mixing sequences from the assumptions about the model; for results about some types of Markov sequences, see Davydov (1973). Meyn and Tweedie (1993) also provide necessary and sufficient conditions for geometric ergodicity of threshold autoregressive linear processes (the function R is piecewise linear, see also Cline and Pu (1998)). Doubly stochastic AR models are geometrically ergodic if 's distribution has an absolutely continuous component and IE|0| < 1 and IE|0| < 1 (see Tjostheim (1986)). For the other models, we refer to Pham (1986), Doukhan (1994) and Ango Nze (1998). 4.2 Associated sequences Associated sequences with finite variances are (,L,  2)-weak dependent with r = supir Cov(X0,Xi) (see Doukhan and Louhichi (1999)). Note that broad classes of examples of associated processes result from the fact that any independent sequence is associated and that monotonicity preserves association (for this, see Newman (1984)). The case of Gaussian sequences is analogous. One may also consider combinations of sums of Gaussian and associated sequences, or Bernoulli shifts driven by stationary, associated, instead of i.i.d. sequences. Linear processes with non-negative coefficients are associated, and so are functional auto-regressive processes with non-decreasing regression functions. Note that for associated or Gaussian sequences, the function  02replaces  2 if r = supir |Cov(X0,Xi)| is replaced by r = Pir |Cov(X0,Xi)|. Giraitis, Kokoszka and Leipus (2000) considered ARCH(1)?models (4.19) with non-negative coefficients and non-negative inputs. In that case the models are also associated. 17
4.3 Bernoulli shifts Definition 4.1 Let (i)i2ZZ be a sequence of i.i.d. real valued r.v's and the function H : IRZZ ! IR be measurable. The sequence (Xn)n2ZZ is called a Bernoulli shift if it is defined by Xn = H(n?j , j 2 ZZ). We refer the reader to Ornstein and Weiss (1990) where such models are motivated through deep ergodic theoretic arguments. One sided shifts are defined as Xn = H(n, n?1, n?2, . . . , 0, ?1, ?2, . . .), i.e. H : IRIN ! IR. The model described in equation (4.16) is an example of such a shift :H(x0, x1, . . . ) = P1j=0 2?1?jxj . The previous model is a simple example of a weakly dependent, but possibly non-mixing sequence. 4.3.1 Markov sequences A general situation where sequences are one sided is the following Markov stationary setting. Consider a Markov process driven by the updating equation Xt = M(Xt?1, t), for some i.i.d. sequence (t)t2ZZ, then the function H if it exists is defined implicitly by the relation H(x) = M(H(x0), x0), where x = (x0, x1, x2, . . .), x0 = (x1, x2, x3, . . .). In order to consider more general Markov sequences one may also refer to the previous section devoted to Markov processes. In order to prove such Bernoulli shift representations, Mokkadem (1990) and Meyn and Tweedie (1993) use the tools of control theory. 4.3.2 Chaotic representations We now specialize the analysis to chaotic expansions associated with the discrete chaos generated by the sequence (i)i2ZZ. Let x = (xi)i2ZZ; we write in a condensed formulation H(x) = P1k=0 H(k)(x), where H(k)(x) denotes the k-th order chaos contribution, H(0)(x) = a(0) 0 is only a centering constant and for k > 0, H(k)(x) = 1X j1=?1 1X j2=?1. . . 1X jk=?1a(k) j1,...,jkxj1xj2 - - - xjk or in short, in vector notation, H(k)(x) = Pj2ZZk a(k) j xj . Processes associated with a finite number of chaotic terms (i.e. H(k) = 0 if k > k0) are also called Volterra processes. The first example of such a Volterra process is clearly the class of linear processes which includes ARMA processes: it corresponds to the consideration of just a term in the first chaos (i.e. k = 1 in the previous representation); it is widely used in the field of statistics (see, for instance, Rosenblatt (1985)). A simple and general condition for IL1-convergence of such series is, still in a condensed notation, P1k=0 nPj2ZZka(k) j oIE|0|k < 1. The simple bilinear process, Xt = (a + bt?1)Xt?1 + t, is stationary if c = IE|a + b0| < 1 (see for instance, Tong (1981)). It is a Bernoulli shift with H(x) = x0+P1j=1 xj Qjs=1(a+bxs), for x = (xi)i2IN. More general affine models are considered in Mokkadem (1990). ARCH(1)?models (see Giraitis, Kokoszka and Leipus, 2000) are given by a sequence (bj)j1 and an i.i.d. sequence of r.v.'s (j)j0 through the recursive relation Xt = 0@a + 1Xj=1 bjXt?j1At. (4.19) 18
Such models have a stationary representation with the chaotic expansion Xt = a 1X`=1 1Xj1=1 - - - 1Xj`=1 bj1 - - - bj`t?j1 - - - t?(j1+---+j`) under the simple assumption IE|0|P1j=1 |bj | < 1. 4.3.3 Mixing properties Finite moving averages Xn = H(n, n?1, . . . , n?m) are trivially m-dependent. The Bernoulli shift Xn = H(n, n?1, . . .) (with H(x) = P1k=0 2?(k+1)xk) is not mixing; this is again example (4.16) of a Markovian, non-mixing5, sequence). The difference between two such independent processes of this type provides an example of a non-associated and non-mixing process. Hence one cannot expect sufficient condition for mixing in such weak shifts. 4.3.4 (,L,  )-weak dependence Contrary to mixing conditions, it can be proven that even two sided sequences can be (,L,  )-weak dependent. For instance, for infinite moving averages Xt = P1?1 ait?i, r = 2IE|0|P|i|>r/2 |ai| and  (h, k, u, v) = (uLip(h) + vLip(k)) . Note also, for completeness, that (NED) conditions can also be deduced for such two-sided models. More generally: Definition 4.2 For any integer k > 0, we denote by r any number such that sup i2ZZ IE|H(i?j , j 2 ZZ) ? H(i?j1I|j|<r, j 2 ZZ)| r. Such sequences (r)r2ZZ+ are related to the modulus of uniform continuity of H; i.e. if for positive constants (ai)i2ZZ, 0 < b 1, the inequality |H(ui, i 2 ZZ) ? H(vi, i 2 ZZ)| Pi2ZZ ai|ui ? vi|b holds for any sequences (ui), (vi) 2 IRZZ and if the sequence (i)i2ZZ has a finite moment of order b, then one can choose r = P|i|r aiIE|i|b. Proposition 4.1 (Doukhan and Louhichi (1999)) . Bernoulli shifts are (,L,  )-weak dependent with r = 2r/2 and  (h, k, u, v) = 4 (ukkk1Lip(h) + vkhk1Lip(k)). If, moreover, the Bernoulli shift is one sided, then it is (,L,  )-weak dependent with r = r and  (h, k, u, v) = 2vLipkkhk1. We turn back to Volterra expansions. A suitable bound for r corresponds here to the stationarity condition r = 1Xk=08< : X j2ZZk;kjk1>ra(k) j 9= ;IE|0|k < 1. 5Its stationary representation writes Xn = P1k=0 2?k?1n?k. Here n?k is the k-th digit in the binary expansion of the uniformly chosen number Xn = 0.nn?1 - - - 2 [0, 1]. This proves that Xn is a deterministic function of X0 which is the main argument to derive that such models are not mixing. The same arguments apply to the model described before of an autoregressive process with innovations taking p distinct values. 19
The one sided example of a simple bilinear process, Xt = (a+bt?1)Xt?1+t, with convergent chaotic representation for c = IE|a + b0| < 1 satisfies r = r = cr(r + 1)/(1 ? c), it has a geometric rate of decay under a stationarity condition set out by Tong (1981). The stochastic volatility model Xn = ? + n exphn 2 , hn = 1Xn=1 jn?j is another example yielding a one sided chaotic decomposition. The sequence (j) is assumed to consists of independent r.v.'s and to be independent of the centered reduced sequence (n). The chaotic representation converges if P|j | < 1 and QIEexp (|j0|) < 1. 4.3.5 Linear processes Using suitable assumptions on the law of 0, the one sided linear processes Xn = P1t=0 atn?t, satisfy -mixing conditions. This requires the absolute continuity of 0's density. If IE0 = 0, and if, moreover, for some > 0, IE|0|1+< 1 and P1t=0 |at| < 1, then n CP1l=n (P1k=l |ak|)/1+, for some C > 0 (Pham and Tran, 1985). See Doukhan6 (1994) for a bibliography, nevertheless, the study of two sided linear sequences herein is not complete. 5 Limit Theorems The aim of this section is to present the state of the art of the limit theorems for stationary sequences. 5.1 The Donsker line Consider a stationary sequence (Xn)n2ZZ. We assume that this sequence is integrable and centered at expectation IEX0 = 0. Denote by [x] the integer part of a real number x ([x] x < [x] + 1). The Donsker line (Dn(t))t2[0,1] is defined for any sample with positive size n as the following continuous time process: Dn(t) =X[nt] k=1Xk + (nt ? [nt])X[nt]+1. We consider the following convergence result in the space C([0, 1]) of continuous functions on the unit interval when the sample size n grows to infinity: Theorem 5.1 The following functional convergence holds in the space C([0, 1]) under any of the weak dependence conditions formulated below:1 pnDn(t) C([0,1]) ????! n!1 Wt. 6If aj = O(j?a), then, under the above regularity and moment conditions, we have n n?b, where b = ((a ? 2)? 1) /(1 + ) and a > 2 + 1/. Therefore, P1n=0 n < 1 holds if a > 3 + 2/. If, for instance, = 1, this becomes a > 5; on the other hand, when = 1, this becomes a > 3 20
Here, 2 = P1?1 Cov(X0,Xk) (the series is assumed to be convergent.) Recall that here (Wt)t2[0,1] is the standard Brownian motion, that is, W denotes the centered Gaussian real valued process with covariance function IEWsWt = min {s, t}. In order to avoid triviality we shall also assume that 6= 0. The above functional central limit theorem (FCLT) is known to hold in the cases below. 5.1.1 Strong mixing case (-mixing) Recall that the quantile function Q of the distribution of X0 is also the c`adl`ag (left continuous with right limits) inverse of the tail function s ! IP(|X0| > s) and that ?1 is the c`adl`ag inverse of the monotone function t ! [t]. The condition Z 1 0 ?1(u)Q2(u)du < 1 (DMR) implies the FCLT in Theorem 5.1 as well as the convergence of the series in the definition of 2 (see Rio (2000) for more details). Let > 0. Assume that moment of order (2 + ) of X0 is finite. Condition (DMR) is equivalent to 1Xn=0 n2/n < 1. The previous FCLT result was obtained by Davydov (1973) under the slightly stronger assumption P1n=0 /(2+) n < 1. In other words, both series converge for the same hyperbolic mixing decays n n?a for a > 1 + 2/. Note that no gain seems to be obtained here when one considers -mixing sequences. 5.1.2 -mixing case The condition 1Xn=0 (2n) < 1 with IEX20 < 1implies the FCLT, as proven by Shao (1988). It is well known that the above conditions ensure a nice behaviour of second order moments. 5.1.3 Associated case The condition 1Xn=0 Cov(X0,Xn) < 1 21
implies the functional convergence (see Newman and Wright, 1981). Clearly, this condition is also necessary to ensure that Theorem 5.1 holds. Notice that the property 'orthogonality implies independence' makes this condition credible for this very special case of an associated sequence. The FCLT is phrased for a strictly stationary negatively associated sequence in identical terms. In fact, the tightness of Dn/pn is shown using an exponential inequality which results from a comparison theorem on moment inequalities proven by Shao (2000). 5.1.4 Nonlinear functions of linear processes We consider two sided linear sequences. If the coefficients in the linear process Xk = P1t=?1 atk?t satisfy at = O(t?(D+1)/2), then Cov(X0,Xn) = r(n) = O(n?D) is the decorrelation rate of the sequence. The FCLT holds under the condition D > 1 (see Giraitis and Surgailis (1986)). Giraitis and Surgailis (1986) prove the result for the partial sums of (Xk) if is some polynomial function with Appell rank m (see definition below). Recall that Appell polynomials are defined through the relation 1Xk=0 zk k!Ak(x)IEexp(zX0) = exp(zx). Like Hermite polynomials, they satisfy a recursive relation: for all k 2 ZZ+, A0k = kAk?1. Setting ?k = IEXk0 , one obtains, for instance, A0(x) = 1,A1(x) = x ? ?1,A2(x) = x2 ? 2?1x + 2?21? ?2, . . . ,Ak(x) = xk + - - - Let F denote the distribution function of X0. An analytic function such that IE2(X0) < 1 has an uniquely defined Appell expansion: (x) = 1Xk=0 ck k!Ak(x), with ck = Z 1 ?1 (k)(x)F(dx) = IE(k)(X0). Now, if the distribution function F is infinitely differentiable, then, setting f = F0 for the density function, one obtains ck = (?1)k R 1 ?1 (x)f(k)(x)dx. A straightforward integration by parts yields IEAk(X0)Ql(X0) = k! if k = l (and = 0 otherwise), with Qk(x) = f(k)(x) f(x) . This means that the system of functions (Ak,Qk)k0 is biorthogonal. It is suitable to define the Appell rank of as the smallest integer m such that cm 6= 0. Appell rank is thus uniquely defined at least for polynomials. The system of Appell polynomials is not orthogonal (except for the special case of Hermite polynomials, which are associated with Gaussian distributions). Hence existence and uniqueness of such expansions follow from additional conditions such as analyticity. We refer to Giraitis and Surgailis (1986) for details. Giraitis and Surgailis (1986) assume the 22
existence of moments of any order and P1n=0 |Cov(X0,Xn)|m < 1. The functional convergence is ensured by the Chentsov tightness criterion, given in the proof section. The reason is that the method of moments is used to prove the CLT. Concerning one sided sequences, Ho and Hsing (1997) obtain an analogous CLT for more general non-linear functionals of a one sided linear sequence. The idea is to approximate such nonlinear functions of a one sided linear sequence by m-dependent moving averages which are easily shown to satisfy a pn-CLT. The main assumptions are IE40 < 1 as well as the following regularity condition. The regularity is twofold. For any subset J of the set IN of nonnegative integers, define X(J) = Pk2J akk (X(IN) = X0). A C1-condition on the functions J (x) = IE(x + XJ ) is required if Card(J) is large enough. Hence, even a very weak regularity condition on the marginal innovations such as |IEexp(iu0)| C/(1 + |u|) for a small > 0, implies the regularity of the distribution of Y J , hence the regularity needed on J 's. Now Burkholder's inequality for Martingales with IE|0|4+< 1 still yields Chentsov tightness criterion. Such linear sequences are also (,L,  ) weakly dependent sequences. Therefore, one may refer to the section devoted to Bernoulli shifts. 5.1.5 Gaussian processes The same finite dimensional central limit theorem as for linear processes holds for instantaneous functions of Gaussian stationary sequences when one replaces m by the Hermite rank of an arbitrary function such that IE2(Yk) < 1 (see Breuer and Major (1983)). However, Donsker's Theorem 5.1 requires an additional tightness condition. Chambers and Slud (1989) introduce such a condition in terms of the coefficients of 's Hermite expansion. Assume that = P1k=m akHk, where P1k=m 3k/2pk!|ak| < 1. This means that an exponential decay of the coefficients is needed to obtain Donsker's theorem. Chambers and Slud provide a result for general stationary processes which are built on a Gaussian chaos. Such functionals may fail to be instantaneous functions (Yn). They can be written as general Bernoulli shifts of (Yn)n2ZZ: Xn = H(Yn, Yn?1, Yn?2, . . .). The authors also consider instantaneous functionals of Gaussian sequences satisfying CLT but not the Donsker theorem. Recall, however, that a smooth lower bound assumption on the spectral density of the process yields -mixing. Hence Theorem 5.1 still holds under slight additional conditions on the Gaussian process. The assumption concerning the function is unchanged: IE2(N(0, 1)) < 1. 5.1.6 (,L,  )-weak dependence Assume a (,L,  )-weak dependence condition with r = O(r?a), for the stationary sequence (Xn)n2ZZ. Suppose also that for some > 0, IE|X0|4+< 1.23
Then if the function   associated to weak dependence is  1 (respectively  2), Doukhan and Louhichi (1999) prove the FCLT if a 2 + 4/(resp. a > 2). So, without any regularity condition on innovations, Theorem 5.1 holds for a bounded Lipschitz function of a linear process if ak = O(k?D) when D > 3. The latter doesn't need to be one sided while Ho and Hsing (1997) need this assumption. Moreover, the functions available are more general than those considered by Giraitis and Surgailis (1986). Finally, a faster hyperbolic decay of coefficients in place of the boundedness assumption for together with the finiteness of the fourth order moment for the innovations yield the FCLT. Define the class Fexp = {hs,u, ks,u; (u, s) 2 IN ? IR} of real-valued functions hs,u(x1, . . . , xu) = sin (s(x1 + - - - + xu)) ks,u(x1, . . . , xu) = cos (s(x1 + - - - + xu)) . Assuming Fexp-weak dependence, we can even improve on above condition by the following uniform bound on the set of integers i j k l and j + r k Cov(XiXj ,XkXl) = O(r?2) and Cov(Xj ,Xk) = O(r?2). 5.1.7 Martingales and generalizations In this section, we consider conditions in terms of conditional expectations with respect to an adapted filtration. We first recall that Theorem 5.1 holds for martingales with stationary square integrable increments such that IEX20 < 1 (see Billingsley (1968)). More generally, let (Xn)n2ZZ be a process adapted to the filtration (Mn)n2ZZ: Xn is Mn-measurable for any n 2 ZZ. The following result is proven by Dedecker and Rio (2000). All ergodicity assumptions are gone. Let T : IRZZ ! IRZZ denote the right shift operator (that is, (T(x))n = xn+1, n 2 ZZ). Denote by I the tail -algebra of T-invariant Borel sets of IRZZ. Theorem 5.2 Assume that IEX2n< 1, IEXn = 0 for any n 2 ZZ and 1Xn=0X0 IE(Xn|M0) is a convergent series in IL1. Denote by Sn = Pni=1 Xi the partial sums. Then the sequence IE(X20 + 2X0Sn|I) converges in IL1 to some r.v. and, conditionally on the tail -algebra I, the process Dn(t)/pn converges to the Brownian motion Wt. Remark This result provides a FCLT with a limit process which is not Gaussian in general. If the sequence is ergodic, a standard Donsker theorem holds. Indeed, ergodicity assumption implies 24
that the r.v. is almost surely constant. Hall and Heyde (1988) give this theorem under a more restrictive IL2 assumption: both series 1Xn=0 IE(Xn|M0) and 1Xn=0 (Xn ? IE(Xn|M0)) converge in IL2. The above Theorem 5.1 under the condition (DMR) stated on page 21 can also be derived as a corollary of Theorem 5.2. The following corollary can be deduced form the above theorem. Consider a stationary Markov sequence (n)n2ZZ with stationary distribution ? and transition operator P. Let Xn = g(n) be a centered at expectation, nonlinear functional of (n)n2ZZ. Then the FCLT holds under the condition of convergence of the series P1n=0 gPng in IL1(?). 5.2 The empirical cumulative distribution Let us consider a stationary sequence (Xn)n2ZZ. We assume without loss of generality that the marginal distribution of this sequence is uniform on [0, 1]. The cumulative distribution of the empirical process, En, of the sequence (Xn)n2ZZ at time n is defined as 1nEn(x), where En(x) =Xn k=1 ??1I(Xkx) ? IP(Xk x). We consider the following convergence result in the Skohorod space D(IR) when the sample size n converges to infinity: 1 pnEn(x) D(IR) ???! n!1 ?B(x). Here (?B(x))x2IR is the dependent analogue of a Brownian bridge, that is, ?Bdenotes the centered Gaussian process with covariance function given by IE?B(x)?B(y) = 1X k=?1(IP(X0 x, Xk y) ? IP(X0 x)IP(Xk y)) . Note that for independent sequences with a marginal cumulative distribution function F, this just means that ?B(x) = B(F(x)) for some standard Brownian Bridge B; this justifies the name of generalized Brownian Bridge. Theorem 5.3 The following functional convergence holds in the Skohorod space of real valued c`adl`ag functions on the real line, D(IR), under the weak dependence conditions detailed in the next subsections 1 pnEn(x) D(IR) ???! n!1 ?B(x). The above covariance function can be rewritten as ??(x, y) = Cov(?B(x), ?B(y)) = ??iid(x, y) +Xk6=0 Tk(x, y) 25
For the i.i.d. case, it is equivalent to ??(x, y) = ??iid(x, y) = F(x)^F(y)?F(x)F(y); as the supremum of two regular functions, this term is intrinsically singular on the diagonal x = y. This is no longer the case for the other terms Tk(x, y) = Cov??1I{X0x}, 1I{Xky}. If, for instance, the second order marginals (X0,Xk) have a continuous joint density, then Tk(x, y) is a C2-function. It is well known that the regularity properties of a Gaussian process are determined by those of its covariance function. Hence, the distortion of the Brownian bridge due to this series is not very important. Either finite dimensional (fidi) or empirical functional convergence (EFCLT) is known to hold in the following cases. 5.2.1 Strong mixing case (-mixing) The condition P1n=0 n < 1 implies finite dimensional convergence. The EFCLT holds if, for some a > 1, n = O(n?a). This result, proven by Rio (2000), improves on the previous conditions a > 1 + p2 formerly given by Shao and Yu (1996), and on the condition a > 3 from Yoshihara (1973). This condition is close to the previous summability, necessary to ensure fidi-convergence. 5.2.2 Absolute regularity condition (-mixing) The condition P1n=0 n < 1 implies finite dimensional convergence. Doukhan, Massart and Rio (1995) obtain the EFCLT Theorem 5.3 when n = O(n?1(log n)?a), for some a > 2. Here tightness obtains with an additional loss term of order (log2 n). Finally, Rio (2000) obtains the simple (and optimal) sufficient condition for EFCLT 1Xn=0 n < 1. In a previous paper Arcones and Yu (1994) have proven central limit theorems for empirical processes indexed by so-called V.C. subgraph classes of functions, not necessarily bounded (see van der Vaart and Wellner (1996), on page 141 for more details). This context contrasts with the common conditions in terms of bracketing numbers. The EFCLT obtains for uniformly bounded classes in the p-th mean under the -mixing condition that np/(p?2) (log(n))2(p?1)/(p?2) n ???! n!1 0 (p 2 ]2,1[). 5.2.3 -mixing case The condition 1Xn=0 (2n) < 1 26
implies fidi convergence, see Peligrad (1987). Shao and Yu (1996) obtain the EFCLT under the same condition. 5.2.4 Gaussian subordinated case Let (Yn)n2ZZ be a standard Gaussian stationary process: IEY0 = 0, IEY 2 0 = 1. Consider a function with Hermite rank m such that IE2(Y0) < 1. Cs?org?o and Mielniczuk (1996) prove the EFCLT for the subordinated field Xn = (Yn) under the natural condition 1Xn=0 |Cov(Y0, Yn)|m < 1. Hence even if the indicator functions do not satisfy the additional tightness assumption in Chambers and Slud (1989), the tightness of the empirical process follows from the diagram formula. In this case the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistics are convergent even if the Donsker theorem does not hold for finite dimensional distributions of the empirical cumulative process. 5.2.5 Associated case We assume that the marginal distribution of X0 is uniform on a interval [0, 1]. Then the condition P1n=0 Cov1/3(X0,Xn) < 1 implies fidi convergence. Louhichi (1998) obtains the EFCLT Theorem 5.3 under the condition that, for some a > 4, Cov(X0,Xn) = O(n?a). Her result improves on Shao and Yu (1996) condition: a > ??3 + p33/2. 5.2.6 One sided linear processes The EFCLT Theorem 5.3 holds if, for some 0 < 1 and S,C,> 0, with S> 2, we have IE|0|S < 1, 1Xt=0 |at|< 1 and |IEexp(iu0)| C 1 + |u|. If the innovations have moments of any order, the existence of some > 0 such that the above inequality holds implies the result. On the other hand, a lower order moment assumption for the innovation allows higher regularity properties. If for example, = 1 and S = 2, the inversion formula shows the existence of a IL1?integrable density. If now = 1 and S = 4, the density must be IL2?integrable. For = 1, this result recovers Doukhan and Surgailis (1998)' proof of the EFCLT when the covariance series is absolutely convergent. The latter paper considers the case S = 4, however, Burkholder's inequality for martingales yields the general result in a straightforward way. 27
5.2.7 (,L,  ) weak dependence The sequence (Xn)n2ZZ is assumed to satisfy a weak dependence condition we now present. sup f2F |Cov(Y2 i=1 f(Xti), Y4 i=3 f(Xti))| r, (5.20) where F = {x ! 1Is<xt, for s, t 2 [0, 1]}, 0 t1 t2 t3 t4 and r = t3 ? t2 (in this case a weak dependence condition holds for a class of functions IRu ! IR working only with the values u = 1 or 2). Proposition 5.1 Let (Xn)n2ZZ be a stationary sequence such that (5.20) holds with r = O(r?5/2?), (5.21) for some > 0. Then the sequence of processes p1n{En(t); t 2 [0, 1]}n>0 is tight in the Skohorod space D([0, 1]). In the same way, stationary mixing sequences satisfy the conditions of Proposition 5.1 if r = O(r?5/2?). This condition is slightly sharper than Yoshihara's condition, r = O(r?3?) for some > 0. Yet, it is slightly sharper than the corresponding result in Shao and Yu (see Theorem 2.2 herein) and Rio (2000)'s result improves on both of them. Theorem 5.4 Suppose that (Xn)n2ZZ is (,L1,  j)-weak dependent. If, either j = 1 and r = O(r?15/2?), or j = 2 and r = O(r?5?), then the empirical functional convergence holds. Remark. The use of the space L allows one to work with each of the classes of models in the previous section (Association and Gaussian sequences enter the first case while the second one corresponds to Bernoulli shifts). This yields new results for Bernoulli shifts, and apparently for Markov sequences. Note that Rio's condition for -mixing sequences improves this result. Moreover, Yu (1993) proves the same result for associated sequences with an exponent loss term 1.5. 6 Functional Estimation We consider a stationary process (Zt)t2ZZ with Zt = (Xt, Yt) where Xt, Yt 2 IR. The quantity of interest is the regression function r(x) = IE(Y0|X0 = x). Let K be some kernel function integrated to 1, Lipschitzian with compact support. The kernel estimators are defined by b f(x) = b fn,h(x) = 1 nh Xn t=1 K x ? Xt h , bg(x) = bgn,h(x) = 1 nh Xn t=1 YtK x ? Xt h , br(x) = brn,h(x) = bgn,h(x) b fn,h(x) if b fn,h(x) 6= 0; br(x) = 0 otherwise. Here h = (hn)n2IN is a sequence of positive real numbers. We always assume that hn ! 0, nhn ! 1 as n ! 1. 28
Definition 6.1 Let = a + b with (a, b) 2 IN?]0; 1]. Define the set of -regular functions Cby C= nu : IR ! IR; u 2 Ca and 9A 0 |u(a)(x) ? u(a)(y)| A|x ? y|b for all x, y in any compact subseto. Here, Ca is the set of a-times continuously differentiable functions. Assuming g 2 C, one can choose a kernel function K of order (not necessarily nonnegative) such that the bias bh satisfies bh(x) = IE(bg(x)) ? g(x) = O(h) uniformly on any compact subset of IR (see Rosenblatt (1993)). If, moreover, is an integer with b = 1, = a ? 1, then with an appropriately chosen kernel K of order , bh(x) g()(x) ! hR sK(s)ds, uniformly on any compact interval. In view of the asymptotic analysis we assume that the marginal density f(.) of X0 exists and is continuous. Moreover, f(x) > 0 for any point x of interest and the regression function r(.) = IE(Y0|X0 = .) exists and is continuous. Finally, for some p 1, x ! gp(x) = f(x)IE(|Y0|p|X0 = x) exists and is continuous. We set g = fr with obvious shorthand notation. Moreover, we impose one of the following moment conditions. Either, IE|Y0|S < 1, for some S p (6.22) or IEexp (|Y0|) < 1. (6.23) 6.1 Second Order Properties We consider first the properties of bg(x). We also consider the following conditionally centered equivalent of g2 appearing in the asymptotic variance of the estimator br, G2(x) = f(x)Var (Y0|X0 = x) = g2(x) ? f(x)r2(x). Assume that the densities of the pairs (X0,Xk), k 2 ZZ+, exist, and are uniformly bounded: sup k>0 kf(k)k1 < 1. Moreover, uniformly over all k 2 ZZ+, the functions r(k)(x, x0) = IE|Y0Yk||X0 = x,Xk = x0(6.24) are continuous. Under these assumptions, the functions g(k) = f(k)r(k) are locally bounded. Theorem 6.1 Suppose that the stationary sequence (Zt)t2ZZ satisfies the conditions (6.23) and (6.24) with p = 2. Suppose that nh ! 1 for some 2]0, 1[. Then pnh (bg(x) ? IEbg(x)) D ???! n!1 N 0, g2(x) Z K2(u)du29
and pnh [bg(x) ? r(x) b f(x)] ? IE[bg(x) ? r(x) b f(x)]D ???! n!1 N 0,G2(x) Z K2(u)duunder any of the weak dependence condition formulated below. In order to consider asymptotics for the ratio estimator br we use a method, already used by Collomb (1984), which consists of studying higher order asymptotics. It is the topic of the next subsection. Theorem 6.2 Suppose that the stationary sequence (Zt)t2ZZ satisfies the conditions (6.23) and (6.24) with p = 2. Consider a positive kernel K. Let f, g 2 Cfor some 2]0, 2], and nh1+2! 0. Then, for all x belonging to any compact subset of IR, pnh br(x) ? r(x)D ???! n!1 N 0, G2(x) f2(x) Z K2(u)duunder any of the weak dependence condition formulated below. 6.1.1 Strong mixing case (-mixing) The above Theorems 6.1 and 6.2 hold if hn ! 0, nhn/log(n) ! 1, and if n = O(n?a) for some a > max {6, 2 + 2} . The proof is based on a Bernstein grouping argument. Besides, Robinson (1983) proves the CLT result in Theorem 5.2 under condition (5.5) for a > 2S/(S?2) without the assumption of positivity of the kernel K. 6.1.2 -mixing case The estimators in Theorem 6.1 obey the CLT under the mixing assumption P1i=1 ??2i< 1 and if the bandwidth condition hn ! 0, nhn/log2(n) ! 1 is fulfilled (see Peligrad, (1995)). The latter CLT Theorem 6.2 holds if, for some > 0, P1i=1 ????2i2/(2+) < 1 and if the bandwidth condition hn ! 0, nhn/log2(n) ! 1 holds. The proof is based on a triangular CLT in Peligrad (1995) combined with moment inequalites 9.16 from Shao (1995). 6.1.3 (,L,  )-weak dependence Assuming that the sequence (Zt)t2ZZ is (,L,  0j)-weak dependent with r = O(r?a) and a > 2+j, for j = 1 or j = 2, Ango Nze, B?uhlmann and Doukhan (2000) prove that, uniformly in x belonging to any compact subset of IR, Var (bg(x)) = 1 nh g2(x) Z K2(u) du + o1 nhand Var bg(x) ? r(x) b f(x)= 1 nhG2(x) Z K2(u) du + o1 nh. 30
The exponential moment assumption can be relaxed. Suppose that the stationary sequence (Zt)t2ZZ satisfies conditions (6.22) and (6.24) with p = 2, S > 2. Former results then hold if the sequence (Zt)t2ZZ is (,L,  j)-weak dependent with r = O(r?a) and a > (2+j)S?4 S?2 + 2 (S?2) , for j = 1 or j = 2. The CLT convergence Theorem 6.1 holds, under the conditions (6.23) and (6.24) with p = 2, if the stationary sequence (Zt)t2ZZ is (,L,  j)-weak dependent with r = O(r?a) and a > j () = min max (2 + j, 3(2 + j)) , max2 + j + 1, 2 + 2(2 + j)1 + !, for j = 1 or j = 2. These results extend Doukhan and Louhichi (1999), valid for the case of the density function b f, to the estimate bg under weak dependence with either  1 or  2. Indeed, the first right hand side term is obtained by Bernstein's blocking technique described in the Appendix. The second right hand side term results from the application of the Lindeberg method (see Rio (2000)). The CLT convergence Theorem 6.2 relies on the expansion u?1 =Xp i=0(?1)i (u ? u0)i ui+1 0 + (?1)p+1 (u ? u0)p+1 uup+1 0 , (6.25) where p = 2, u = bn, u0 = IEbn = 1, and br(x) = an/bn (if bn 6= 0) with an = Xn i=1 YiK x ? Xi hn /nIEK x ? X0 hn , and bn = Xn i=1 K x ? Xi hn /nIEK x ? X0 hn . Using the Rosenthal inequalities described in the Appendix and the aforementioned CLT, we obtain the CLT convergence Theorem 6.2 for the regression function, under conditions (6.23) and (6.24) with p = 2, if the stationary sequence (Zt)t2ZZ is (,L,  j)-weak dependent with r = O(r?a), a > j () and a > max 3, 9 (2 + j) 7 ? 4!, for j = 1 or j = 2. The results stated in Theorem 6.1 and Theorem 6.2 also hold for finite dimensional convergence. The components are asymptotically jointly independent, much in the same way that for i.i.d. sequences. Moreover, Rios (1996) proves that the local linearity test can be handled in the strong mixing case. The function r is assumed to be continuous. Then the plug-in estimator b T = R br2(x)w(x)dx converges to T = R r2(x)w(x)dx if n = O(n?a) and a > 2 + 3/and the bandwidth condition hn 2 [n?1/10, n?1/(2?4)]. 6.2 Almost Sure Convergence Properties Theorem 6.3 Let (Zt)t2ZZ be a stationary sequence satisfying the conditions (6.23) and (6.24) with p = 2. Then under the conditions formulated in the subsections below, 31
(i) There exists a sequence (n)n2IN with nh/(n log(n)) ! 1 as n ! 1 such that for any M > 0, sup |x|M |bg(x) ? IEbg(x)| = O rn log(n) nh ! almost surely. (ii) Assume now that inf|x|M f(x) > 0. If f, g 2 Cfor some 2]0,1[, h n log(n) n 1/(1+2), then sup |x|M |br(x) ? r(x)| = O(n log(n) n /(1+2)) almost surely. Remark Under conditions (ii) of Theorem 6.3, but assuming only the weaker condition about the bandwidth sequence nh ! 1 for some 2]0, 1[, we obtain sup |x|M |br(x) ? r(x)| = o(1) almost surely. 6.2.1 Strong mixing case (-mixing) Liebscher (1996) proves the uniform almost sure convergence at the optimal rate (n = 1) if r = O(r?a), with a > 4 + 3/. 6.2.2 -mixing case Peligrad (1991) states a uniform almost sure convergence result with n = log(n) if k = O(k?r), with r > (+ 1)/2. 6.2.3 (,L,  1)-weak dependence case For the sake of simplicity, we only consider the geometrically dependent case. Theorem 6.4 Let (Zt)t2ZZ be a stationary sequence satisfying the conditions (6.23) and (6.24) with p = 2, and either (,L,  1) or (,L,  2)-weak dependent with r ar for some 0 < a < 1. (i) If nh/log4(n) ! 1, then for any M > 0, almost surely, sup |x|M |bg(x) ? IEbg(x)| = Olog2(n) pnh . (ii) For any M > 0, if f, g 2 Cfor some 2]0,1[, h log4(n) n 1/(1+2) and inf|x|M f(x) > 0, then, almost surely, sup |x|M |br(x) ? r(x)| = O(log4(n) n /(1+2)). 32
7 Conclusion This paper presented the new weak dependence condition of Doukhan, Louhichi (1999). It is related to some of the most popular conditions used by econometricians to transcribe the notion of fading memory. The new dependence condition has the advantage that it allows consideration of a broader class of models. This natural weak dependence condition also fits well with the more general (stationary) models used in econometrics. As we have illustrated, most applications of interest can be set out under this weaker dependence condition. Moreover, our framework is a very natural one for bootstrapping techniques. We have also provided several useful limit theorems. Acknowledgements We first wish to thank the editor for the huge amount of additional editorial work provided for this review paper.

8 Appendix A: Proofs 8.1 Proofs for Section 4: Models Proof of Proposition 4.1 Let A = i1, . . . , iu and B = j1, . . . , jv be two finite subsets of ZZ with i1 - - - iu < iu + r j1 - - - jv. Set Xn = H (n?j , j 2 ZZ), and, for a given integer k, X(k) n = H ??n?j1I|j|<k, j 2 ZZ. Then for any functions h, k 2 L with obvious notations Cov (h (Xn, n 2 A) , k (Xn, n 2 B)) Cov (hA (Xn, n 2 ZZ) , kB (Xn, n 2 ZZ)) = Cov hA (Xn, n 2 ZZ) ? hA X(k) n , n 2 ZZ, kB (Xn, n 2 ZZ)+ Cov hA X(k) n , n 2 ZZ, kB (Xn, n 2 ZZ) ? kB X(k) n , n 2 ZZ+ Cov hA X(k) n , n 2 ZZ, kB X(k) n , n 2 ZZ. If p r/2, the r.v.'s hA X(k) n , n 2 ZZand kB X(k) n , n 2 ZZare measurable with respect to the independent -fields (i : i1 ? p < i < iu + p) and (j : j1 ? p < j < jv + p). Therefore, the last covariance term is null. Besides, set C =Cov hA (Xn, n 2 ZZ) ? hA X(k) n , n 2 ZZ, kB (Xn, n 2 ZZ). Then, C 2kkk1IEhA (Xn, n 2 ZZ) ? hA X(k) n , n 2 ZZ4ukkk1kLip(h) in the one sided case. The two sided case is handled similarly. 2 8.2 Proofs for Section 5: Functional CLT Sketch of the Proof of Theorem 5.1 in the -mixing case. With the notations of Rosenthal inequality in Lemma 9.10, Sn/pn converges in distribution to the normal distribution N??0, 2, where 2 = lim n?1Var(Sn) is assumed to be positive. The tightness of the process (Dn(t)) is derived according to Lemma 9.1. Since the sequence ??S2n/nis uniformly integrable, there exists a convex function G increasing faster than x at infinity, such that IEGS2n n 1. By a blocking argument, it follows that (see details in Proposition 2 in Rio (2000)) IP??Sn(3 + 2)pnp G(p) + pq?1 + 2 G(2) . (8.1) Here p = [pn] and q = [n/p]. Tightness condition obtains as soon as nn ! 0. 2 Sketch of the Proof of Theorem 5.1 in the -mixing case. The proof follows the same lines as in the -mixing case. Details are developed in Lin and Lu' book (1996) (see Section 4.1 therein). 2 Sketch of the Proof of Theorem 5.1 in the weak dependent case. Lemma 9.12 and a maximal inequality by Moricz and al. (1982) yield IE|Sn|2+= On1+/2(8.2) 38
as soon as for any increasing sequence of integers 0 i < j < k l 1Xm=0m IE|X0Xm| < 1 and Cov (XiXj ,XkXl) = O??(k ? j)?2. (8.3) Moreover, this entails that 2 = lim n?1Var(Sn) > 0, so that the fidi convergence is obtained. The tightness of the process is a consequence of (8.3). The first part of (8.3) follows from the covariance bound |Cov (X0,Xr) | = O(2+)/(4+) r . The latter bound follows from Cov (XiXj ,XkXl) = O/(4+) k?j . 2 8.3 Proofs for Section 5: Empirical process Proof of Proposition 5.1. Using the Rosenthal inequality in Lemma 9.12, we get kEn(t) ? En(s)k4 Cpn nX?1 r=0 minnr?5/2?, |t ? s|o +  n nX?1 r=0 (r + 1)2 r!1/4 , pn |t ? s|(a?1)/2a + n(2?a)/4. Conclusion follows from Lemma 9.4 in Shao and Yu (1996). 2 Proof of Theorem 5.4. Lemma 9.13 8.4 Proofs for Section 6: Functional estimation 8.4.1 Second order properties Proof of Theorem 6.1. We proceed as in Rio (2000) and more specifically as in Doukhan and Coulon (1999) for density estimation. Consider a sequence (Wn)n2IN of i.i.d. r.v.'s with standard normal distribution independent of ((Xt, Yt))t2ZZ and set M(n) = log(n), nh2n= Var (Pnt=1 Tt(x)) . Here Tt(x) = ??Yt 1I{|Yt|M(n)} +M(n)1I{Yt>M(n)} ?M(n)1I{Yt<?M(n)}K x ? Xt h (0 t n) (8.4) denotes the estimator truncated at level M(n) by a Lipschitz continuous function. Define t = 1 npnh (Tt(x) ? IETt(x)) , Sk = Xk t=1 t, 1 k n, with S0 = 0, k = Xn t=k Vt, 1 k n, with n+1 = 0, where vk 2n= |Var (Sk) ? Var (Sk?1)| and Vk = pvk n Wk. Let ' denote a three times differentiable function with bounded derivatives up to order 3, and consider the following r.v.'s: Ut = St?1 + t+1, Rt(x) = ' (Ut + x) ? ' (Ut) ? vt 22n'00 (Ut) (1 t n). 39
We are interested in establishing that n ! g2(x) Z K2(u)du1/2 , (8.5) pnh (bg(x) ? IEbg(x)) ? nSn IL2!0, (8.6) Sn D ???! n!1 N (0, 1) . (8.7) We consider either a (,L,  1) or a (,L,  01)-weakly dependent sequence (Zt)t2ZZ. We shall follow the practical abuse of notation, in which the same letter C is used for different constants. Formula (8.6) is easily proven using the exponential moment assumption (6.23). In order to prove formula (8.7), we apply the so-called Lindeberg-Rio method (see Rio (2000)). Clearly, |IE' (Sn) ? IE' (W0)| Xn t=1 |IERt(t)| + Xn t=1 |IERt(Vt)| . (8.8) Since |IERt(Vt)| = IE' (Ut + Vt) ? ' (Ut) ? Vt'0 (Ut) ? V 2 t2'00 (Ut)16IEV 3 t '(3) (Ut + #Vt), with 0 < # < 1, k'(3)k1 6 vt 2n 3/2 IE|W0|3 , and vt 2n= |Var (St) ? Var (St?1) | C 0@1n + Xt?1 j=1 1 nh minM2(n)t?j h , h21A, we obtain Xn t=1 |IERt(Vt)| C3n Xn t=1 v3/2 t C n3/23n Xn t=1 0@1 + Xt?1 j=1 minM2(n)j h2 , h1A3/2 . (8.9) Moreover, Rt(t) = ' (Ut + t) ? ' (Ut) ? vt 22n'00 (Ut) = t'0 (Ut) + 12 2t ? vt 22n '00 (Ut) + 163t '(3) (Ut + #tt) , with 0 < #t < 1. 40
It then follows that Xn t=1 |IERt(t)| IE nX?1 t=1 Cov (0, t) Xn k=t+1 '00 (Uk)!+ 12 Xn t=1 IE??'00 (Ut) ??2t ? IE2t + Xn t=1 Xt?1 j=1 Cov ??'00 (St?1?j + j+1) t?j , t+ Xn t=1 Cov ??t, '0 (t+1)+ 12 Xn t=1 Xt?1 j=1 Cov '(3) (St?1?j + j+1 + #t?jt?j) 2t?j , t+ 16 Xn t=1 IE'(3) (Ut + tt) 3t = E1 + E2 + E3 + 0 + E4 + E5. (8.10) We can now bound the five terms above. E1 Xn t=1 |Cov (0, t)| Xn k=t+1 IE'00 (Ut)C nh2n Xn t=1(n ? t) mint h , h2. (8.11) In the (,L,  01) case, E2 12 Xn t=2 Xt?1 j=1 Cov'(3) (Sj?1 + jj + k+1) j , 2t 2 + Xn t=1 Cov'00(k+1), 2t 2 CM(n) npnh3 Xn t=2 Xt?1 j=1 min(t ? j)M2(n)j h , h2+ Ch 2n, (8.12) E3 Xn t=1 Xt j=1 C nh2nminM2(n)(t ? j)j h , h2, (8.13) E4 Xn t=1 Xt j=1 C npnh3 minM3(n)(t ? j)j h , h2M(n), (8.14) E5 C (npnh)3 Xn t=1 h C 3n pnh. (8.15) For a (,L,  1)-weak dependent sequence, using again (8.9)-(8.15), we need r = O(r?a) with a > 3 + 1. If the sequence (Zt)t2ZZ is (,L,  01)-weak dependent with r = O(r?a) for some a > 3, then by (8.9)-(8.15) the right hand side term of (8.8) tends to zero as n?1. The CLT for bg is now proved. The second assertion is a consequence of the first one, where Yt is replaced by Yt ? r(x). 2 41
8.4.2 Almost sure convergence Proof of Theorem 6.3. We keep usual notations and denote by C a universal constant (whose value can change from one place to another). Assume that IE(exp(|Y0|)) < 1. Then IP  sup |x|M |bg ? ?g|(x) > 0! nIP(|Y0| M0 log(n)) Cn1?M0 , and, by the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, sup |x|M IE(|bg ? ?g|(x)) 1h IE"|Y0|1I{|Y0|M0 log(n)}|K x ? X0 h |# 1hh1/3n?M0 . We can now reduce computations to the case of a density estimator, as in Doukhan and Louhichi (1999). Assume that the interval [?M,M] is covered by Lintervals with diameter 1/(here = (n) depends on n and we denote by Ij the j-th interval and xj the center of the interval). Assume that the relation h! 1 holds (for n ! 1). Assume that the compactly supported kernel K vanishes if t > R0. Liebscher (1996) exhibits another kernel-type density estimate ?g0 based on an even, continuous, kernel, decreasing on [0,1[, constant on [0, 2R0], taking the value 0 at t = 3R0. Then, he proves that sup x2Ij |?g ? IE?g|(x) |?g(xj) ? IE?g(xj)| + C h??|?g0 ? IE?g0|(xj) + 2|IE?g0|(xj). Therefore, for any > 0, IPsup x2[?M,M] |bg(x) ? IEbg(x)| 2pnh + 1hh1/3n?M0 + C log(n) hn1?M0 + LIP|?g ? IE?g|(x1)| pnh+ LIP|?g0 ? IE?g0|(x1) pnh. Exponential inequality (DPL) which can be found in Section 9.4.1 of Appendix B completes the proof of assertion (i). 2 Remark. Zhao and Fang (1994) prove almost sure convergence, uniform on compact sets, of the kernel regression estimator for strongly mixing stationary process under the same condition as in Theorem 6.3. Let us consider a strongly mixing processes that satisfies conditions (6.23), (6.24) with p = 2. Assume that f, g 2 Cfor some 2]0,1[ and nh ! 1 for some 2]0, 1[. If the moment condition (6.22) holds with S > 4 + 2, and if the mixing rate is r r?a for some a > 4 such that a > max2S S ? 2, S(S + 4)(1 + ) (S ? 2)(S? 4+ 4), (S + 1)(3 + 4) S ? 2 ? 4, then, almost surely, sup |x|M |br(x) ? r(x)| = O (n?1 log(n))/(1+2). 42
9 Appendix B: Technical Lemmas 9.1 Sufficient conditions for tightness 9.1.1 Kolmogorov-Chentsov criterion In order to obtain functional convergence in distribution it is usual to make use of some chaining argument in order to prove tightness of the sequence (Yn(t))n1, where Yn(t) = Dn(t)/pn, in the space C([0, 1]). Chaining techniques can be found in Pollard (1981). For the sake of completness, we recall the following tightness result deduced from the Arzela-Ascoli theorem. Lemma 9.1 (Billingsley (1968)) The sequence of processes (Yn(t))t2[0,1] is a tight sequence in the space C([0, 1]) for n = 1, 2, . . . if for each , > 0, there exists a > 0, and an integer n0 such that for all t 2 [0, 1] 1IP  sup s2[t,t+] |Yn(s) ? Yn(t)| ! for n n0. To conclude the section we recall the standard Kolmogorov-Chentsov tightness criterion, adapted to moment inequalities: Lemma 9.2 (Billingsley (1968)) A sequence of continuous processes (Zn(t))t2[0,1] is tight in the space C([0, 1]) for n = 1, 2, . . . if there exist constants C > 0, p > 0, q > 1, such that for any s, t 2 [0, 1]: IE|Zn(s) ? Zn(t)|p C|t ? s|q. 9.1.2 Tightness of the empirical process We now recall a tightness criterion in the Skohorod space D([0, 1]), of left continuous with right limits functions on the interval. Note that we can restrict ourselves to the case of marginal uniform distributions. Lemma 9.3 (Billingsley (1968)) A sequence of c`adl`ag (right continuous with left limits) processes (Zn(x))x2[0,1] is tight in D([0, 1]) if : For any > 0 there exists an a > 0 such that IPsupx2[0,1] |Zn(x)| > a< for any n 1. : For any , > 0 there exists a sequence 0 = x0 < x1 < - - - < xp = 1, and an integer n0 such that IPmax0i<p supx2[xi,xi+1[ |Zn(x) ? Zn(xi)| > < for n n0. To conclude the section, we recall a chaining lemma a proof of which can be found in Shao and Yu (1996); this result can be used in order to prove tightness of the empirical process when the 4-th order moment involved (p = 4) is bounded. The absolutely regular case is an exception for which a more general technique is used by Rio (2000). 43
Lemma 9.4 (Shao and Yu (1996)) Let Xn be a stationary sequence with marginal cumulative function F. Then the empirical Brownian bridge (En(x)/pn)x2IR is a tight sequence in the Skohorod space D(IR) if there exist constants C > 0, p > 2, q > 1, and u > 0, 0 v 1, with u + v > 1 such that for any x, y 2 IR: IE1 pn(En(x) ? En(y))p C |F(x) ? F(y)|q + |F(x) ? F(y)|v nu/2 . 9.2 Tools under mixing 9.2.1 Covariance inequalities A fundamental covariance inequality due to Rio (2000) extends on the previously known ones. First, recall the following definition. Definition 9.1 The quantile function QX of the real valued r.v. X is the c`adl`ag inverse of the tail function of |X|, QX(s) = inf{t > 0; IP(|X| > t) s}. We are now in position to state the fundamental covariance inequality. Lemma 9.5 (Rio (2000)) Let u, v be two real valued r.v.'s with finite variance. Then, setting = ((u), (v)), we have |Cov(u, v)| 2 Z 20 Qu(t)Qv(t) dt. Since |X|p = R 1 0 1I{t<|X|p} dt, we find by taking expectations that IE|X|p = Z 1 0 IP(t < |X|p) dt = Z 1 0 Z 1 0 1I{s<IP(t<|X|p)} dsdt. Hence a simple use of Fubini theorem yields, for p > 0, the identity IE|X|p = R 1 0 QpX(s)ds. Thus, using H?older's inequality, we deduce |Cov(u, v)| 21+1r 1r kukpkvkq, if 1p + 1q + 1r = 1 and p, q, r > 0. Similar covariance inequalities are available for other mixing type sequences. Namely: Lemma 9.6 (Bradley and Bryc (1985)) Let u, v be two real valued random variables. Set = ((u), (v)). Let p > 0 and q > 0 be such that 1/p + 1/q = 1. Then |Cov(u, v)| 3000(1 ? log )min{ 1p , 1q }kukpkvkq. Lemma 9.7 (Ibragimov (1962)) Let u, v be two real valued random variables. Set = ((u), (v)). Let p > 0 and q > 0 be such that 1/p + 1/q = 1. Then |Cov(u, v)| 21/pkukpkvkq. 44
9.2.2 Reconstruction lemmas Such results exist in the -mixing and -mixing cases. The first one is due to Berbee (1979) and the second one is due to Rio (1995). The reader is referred to Rio (2000) for further details. Lemma 9.8 (Berbee (1979)) Let u, v be two r.v.'s defined on the probability space ??,F, IPand taking their values in Polish spaces U, V. Then, enlarging the probability space if it is necessary, it is possible to define a r.v. vwith the same distribution as v and such that u and vare independent r.v.'s and IP(v 6= v) = ((u), (v)). We shall use a similar device for real-valued strong mixing sequences. Lemma 9.9 (Rio (2000)) Let A be a -field of (,F, IP) and let v be a real-valued r.v.'s with values (a.s.) in [a, b]. Suppose, furthermore, that there exists a r.v. U with uniform distribution on [0, 1] independent of A and (v). Then there exists a r.v. vindependent of A with the same distribution as v, (A, v,U)-measurable, and such that IE|v ? v| 2(b ? a)(A, (v)). 9.2.3 Rosenthal inequalities First applications of Rosenthal type inequalities can be found in Billingsley (1968). They concern the Kolmogorov-Smirnov functional CLT for the empirical cumulative distribution of a -mixing sequence. A nice and general presentation of applications of Rosenthal inequalities to functional CLT is provided in Andrews and Pollard (1994). Maximal Rosenthal inequalities are available either in the -mixing or in the -mixing case. For simplicity we consider stationary sequences (Xn)n2ZZ, such that for some real number r 2, IEX0 = 0 and IE|X0|r < 1, and we set Sn = X1 + - - - + Xn and Sn= max{|S1|, . . . , |Sn|}. Similarly, ?1 denotes the inverse of the decreasing function s ! [s] (where [s] 2 ZZ denotes the integral part of s 2 IR) defined by?1(t) = 1Xk=0 1I{k>t} 8t 2 IR. Lemma 9.10 (Rio (1994)) Let (Xn) be a strong mixing sequence, and for r 2, set: Mr,,n = Z 0 n [?1(t)QX0(t)]r dt ?1(t) and Mr,= Mr,,1. Then there exists a constant Cr only depending on r such that IE(Sn)r Cr q(nM2,,n)r + nMr,,n. 45
For example, an explicit computation gives Mr,= Mr,,1 < 1 if 1Xk=0 (k + 1)r?2 Z k 0 QrX0(t)dt < 1. This implies the maximal Rosenthal inequality IE(Sn)r Cr np(nM2,)r + nMr,o. Assume now that IE|X0|r+< 1for some positive . Then the integralMr,= R 1 0 [?1(t)]r?1[QX0(t)]rdt can be bounded using H?older's inequality and the relation R 1 0 [QX0(t)]pdt = IE|X0|p: Mr,Z 1 0 [?1(t)](r+)(r?1)/dt/(r+) IE|X0|r+r/(r+) . The integral in the RHS of the previous inequality can be written as a sum, yielding, after the use of the Abel transformation and the simple inequality (n+1)p ?np p(n+1)p?1 which follows for p > 1 from the use of the mean value theorem, Z 1 0 [?1(t)](r+)(r?1)/dt = 1Xn=0 n(r?1)(1+r/)(n ? n?1) (r + )(r ? 1) 1Xn=0 (n + 1)r?2+r(r?1)/n. If IE|X0|r+< 1 and P1n=0 (n + 1)r?2+r(r?1)/n < 1, the moment Mr,is finite. Lemma 9.11 (Shao (1995)) Let (Xn) be a -mixing sequence, and set for r 2 and some constant Kr,depending only on r and :Kr,,n = exp0@Kr,[loXg2 n] k=0 2r 2k1A. (9.16) Then there exists a constant Cr,depending only on r and on such that IE(Sn)r Cr,nK2,,n??nkXk22 r/2 + Kr,,n (nkXkrr)o. This follows from Bradley and Bryc' lemma and from several important lemmas in Peligrad (1987). Peligrad (1987)'s work yields maximal bounds for the moments of sums of n-samples of order 2 and 4 which only involve the sums P[log2(n)] k=0 (2k). 9.3 Tools under association The following inequality is essential for studying associated random variables. Theorem 9.1 (Newman (1984)) For a pair of measurable numeric functions (f, g) defined on A IRk, we write f << g if both functions g+f and g?f are nondecreasing with respect to each argument. Let now X be any associated random vector with range in A. Then (fi << gi, for i = 1, 2) ) Cov(f1(X), f2(X))Cov(g1(X), g2(X)). 46
This theorem follows simply from several applications of the definition to the coordinatewise nondecreasing functions gi?fi and gi+fi. By an easy application of the above inequalities one can check that |Cov(f(X), g(Y ))| Xk i=1 Xl j=1 @f @xi 1 @g @yj 1 Cov(Xi, Yj), (9.17) for IRk or IRl valued associated random vectors X and Y and C1 functions f and g with bounded partial derivatives. For this, it suffices to note that f << f1 if one defines f1(x1, . . . , xp) = Xp i=1 @f @xi 1 |xi| and uses Theorem 9.1. Denote by R(z) the real part of the complex number z. Theorem 9.1 can be extended to complex valued functions, up to a factor 2 in the left hand side of the above inequality (9.17). Indeed, we can set now f << g if for any real number ! the mapping t = (t1, . . . , tk) ! R??g(t) + ei!(t1+---+tk)f(t)is non-decreasing with respect to each argument. Also, for any real numbers t1, . . . , tk, IEei(t1X1+---+tkXk) ? IEeit1X1 - - - IEeitkXk 2 Xk i=1 Xk j=1 |ti||tj |Cov(Xi,Xj). If now the r.v.'s Xi have a density, bounded uniformly w.r.t the index i, then r := sup x,y |i?j|r Cov(1I{Xi>x}, 1I{Xj>y}) c sup |i?j|r Cov1/3(Xi,Xj). (9.18) This relation provides a connection between L and I?weak dependences (the class I shall be defined in (9.26) of the next Section 9.4) in the context of associated sequences. The negatively associated r.v.'s are much simpler to handle. The key result is a comparison theorem established by Shao (2000). For any convex function f on IR, IEf   Xn i=1 Xi! IEf   Xn i=1 Xi ! (9.19) for a given sequence (Xi)1in of negatively associated r.v.'s and for any sequence (Xi )1in of independent r.v.'s such that Xi D=Xi for each i = 1, . . . , n. In order to avoid triviality, we assume that the right hand side term above exists. 9.4 Tools under weak dependence 9.4.1 Moment and exponential inequalities Let (Xn)n2IN be a sequence r.v's with IEXn = 0 and let Sn = Pni=1 Xi. In this section, we give moment bounds for |IESqn|, when q 2 IN and q 2. For positive integers r, define coefficients of weak dependence as non-decreasing sequences (Cr,q)q2 such that Cov ??Xt1 ? - - - ? Xtm,Xtm+1 ? - - - ? XtqCr,q , 47
for 1 t1 - - - tq n and, for integers 1 m < q, tm+1 ? tm = r. Doukhan and Louhichi (1999) provide explicit bounds Cr,q in order to construct inequalities for partial sums Sn. Two kinds of bounds are considered, either Cov ??Xt1 ? - - - ? Xtm,Xtm+1 ? - - - ? XtqcqMq?2r, (9.20) or Cov ??Xt1 ? - - - ? Xtm,Xtm+1 ? - - - ? Xtqc Z r 0 QXt1 (x) ? - - - ? QXtq (x) dx, (9.21) where QX still denotes X's quantile function and c, 0 denote real numbers. In the examples, bound (9.20) holds for bounded sequences such that kXnk1 M. For instance, (,L,  )-weak dependence yields the bounds Cr,q = max 1m<q  (jm, j(q?m), m, q ? m)Mqr, where j(x) = x1I{|x|1} + 1I{x>1} ? 1I{x<?1}. As in Lemma 1 of Doukhan and Louhichi (1999), we see that under (,L,  )-weak dependence with  (h, k, u, v) = c(u, v)Lip(h)Lip(k), a bound is Cr,q = max 1m<q c(m, q ? m)Mq?2r. Bound (9.21) holds for more general r.v's, as can be shown using moment or tail assumptions. A first consequence of the previous definitions is the following Marcinkiewicz-Zygmund inequality. Let (Xn)n2IN be a sequence of r.v's with IEXn = 0 satisfying the condition Cr,q = O(r?q/2). (9.22) Then, there exists a constant B > 0 independent of n for which |IESqn| Bnq/2. (9.23) The following lemma gives moment inequalities with q 2 {2, 4}. It was essentially proved in Billingsley (1968, Lemmas 3 and 4, page 172). Lemma 9.12 (Doukhan and Louhichi (1999)) If (Xn)n2IN is a sequence of r.v's with IEXn = 0, then IES2n2n nX?1 r=0 Cr,2, IES4n4!8< : n nX?1 r=0 Cr,2!2 + n nX?1 r=0(r + 1)2Cr,49= ;. (9.24) The following theorems deal with higher order moments. Theorem 9.2 (Doukhan and Louhichi (1999)) Let q 2 be some integer. Assume that dependence coefficients Cr,p of the sequence (Xn) satisfy Cr,p = CepMp?2r, (H1) 48
for all integers 0 < p q and for some positive constants M, , C. Then, for any integer n 2, |IESqn| (2q ? 2)! (q ? 1)! eq8< : Cn nX?1 r=0 r!q/2 _  CMq?2n nX?1 r=0(r + 1)q?2r!9= ;. (9.25) Theorem 9.2 is adapted to work with bounded sequences. Define the class I by I = nOui=1gxi ; xi 2 IR+, u 2 INo, where gx(y) = 1Ixy ? 1Iy?x, 8x 2 IR+. (9.26) In order to consider the unbounded case, we shall consider (, I,  )-weak dependence where  (h, k, u, v) = c(u, v). Theorem 9.3 (Doukhan and Louhichi (1999)) Let (Xn)n2IN be a (, I,  )-weak dependent sequence with IEXn = 0, and set Cq = (maxu+vq c(u, v)) _ 2. Then |IESqn| (2q ? 2)! (q ? 1)!  Cq Xn i=1 Z 1 0 (?1(u) ^ n)q?1Qqi (u)du _ C2 Xn i=1 Z 1 0 (?1(u) ^ n)Q2i(u)duq/2!. In the special case of strongly mixing and stationary sequences, this is Theorem 1 in Rio (1994). The explicit form of the constants compensates for the fact that we are restricted to even integers. Remark. Exponential inequalities can be obtained using Theorem 9.2. Define Mq,n = n nX?1 r=0(r + 1)q?2Cr,q . We first suppose that for all integers q 2 and n: Cr,p = CepMp?2r, Mq,n An q! q , where is some constant and An is a sequence independent of q. Then the following Doukhan-Portal type exponential inequality is available: IP??|Sn| xpAnAexp ???Bpx. (DPL) One can take here the constants A = e4+1/12p8and B = e5/2?/2. Let (Xn) be a sequence of r.v.'s with IEXn = 0. Inequality (DPL) holds when Cr,q = C2Mq?2eqe?br for suitable constants C, , , b > 0, if kXnk1 M and kXnk2 , for any integer n 0. In this case, An = n2. For example, inequality (DPL) holds under (,L,  )-weak dependence if r = O(e?br) and  (h, k, u, v) e(u+v)Lip(h)Lip(k) for some 0. The use of combinatorics in the above inequalities makes them relatively weak. For instance, Bernstein's inequality, valid for independent sequences allows one to replace the term px in the above inequality by x2 under the same assumption n2 1; in the mixing cases similar inequalities are also obtained using coupling arguments which are not available here. 49
Shao (2000) utilizes his main comparison result (9.19) in order to show that most of inequalities for independent r.v.'s remain true for negatively associated r.v.'s, even with respect to the constants. For instance, a Rosenthal inequality is proved. Recalling that Sn= max {|S1| , . . . , |Sn|}, we have that for any real number p > 2, IESnp 215p ln (p)p q??n IEX20 p + n IE|X0|p. (9.27) An exponential inequality is also derived for negatively associated r.v.'s. It is as sharp as the Bernstein's inequality for independent r.v.'s. Shao (2000)'s results can also be combined to those in the papers by Ibragimov and Sharakhmetov (2001) and de la Pe?na et al. (2003) in view to obtain sharp versions of Rosenthal inequalities. These inequalities concern general moments of partial sums of negatively associated sequences of nonnegative and symmetric r.v.'s as well as mean zero r.v.'s in the case of even power p. A symmetrization argument gives improvements of formula (9.27) in the context of mean zero r.v.'s and arbitrary power p. Proof of the Lemma 2.1. As an application of the above results, let us turn to the proof of a correct version of Lemma 1 in Hall and Horowitz (1996). Set i,n = i1I{|i|n1/16} ? IEi1I{|i|n1/16} and let eRn = 1n Pni=1 i,n. Then IP|Rn| > 2n?2+5 IP|eRn| > n?2+5 + 2n1+2+5 IEi1I{|i|>n1/16}n?32(2+) 5 IE|Rn|32 + 2n1+2+5 k1k4IP34 |1| > n 1 16 = n?1On?11+325 + n5? 47 320 = o(n?1) 9.4.2 Central Limit Theorem FollowingWithers (1981) and Newman (1984), the CLT holds if 2 = lim n!1 1nVar (X1 + - - - + Xn) > 0 (this limit is assumed to exist), and the sequence S2n n is uniformly integrable. Define Fexp by the class of complex exponential functions of complex exponential functions f such that f(x1, . . . , xp) = exp(itf (x1 + - - - + xp)) for some tf 2 IR and p 2 IN. The function   is defined for this class by  exp(f, g, p, q) = pq(1 + tf tg). Let Fexp r be the dependence coefficient associated to the above function class. The CLT holds for a (,L,  )-weak dependent sequence with Lr = O(r?2) and lim r!1Fexp r = 0. The inclusion Fexp L implies that the CLT holds under a (,L,  )-weak dependence condition, with  (h, k, u, v) = min(u, v)Lip(h)Lip(k) + 1. Notice that the above condition Lr = O(r?2) holds for associated r.v.'s where Pn Cov (X0,Xn) < 1. Proposition 9.1 (Doukhan and Louhichi (1999)) The CLT holds under (,L,  )-weak dependence if   (h, k, u, v) = min{u, v}? (Lip(h), Lip(v)) for some locally bounded real function on IR2+. It also holds if, for some d > 0,   (h, k, u, v) = (u + v)d? (Lip(h), Lip(v)) and, for some D > d, r = O(r?D). 50
The proof is based on a more general lemma (see for instance Ibragimov (1962) and Withers (1981)) setting Yk = (Xk). Let (Yn)n2IN be a stationary sequence. The idea is to split Sn = Pnk=1 Yk into Bernstein's blocks. Lemma 9.13 (Ibragimov (1962)) Let (Yk) be a stationary sequence of centered r.v.'s. Let p = p(n), q = q(n), k = [ n p+q ] be integer-valued functions satisfying p ! 1, q ! 1, q = o(p), p = o(n), as n ! 1. (9.28) We define Bernstein blocks as i = ip+X(i?1)q (i?1)(p+q)+1 Yj , i = i(Xp+q) ip+(i?1)q+1 Yj , for 1 i k, and k+1 = Xn k(p+q)+1 Yj . Then we set Sn = Zk + Z0k+1, with Zk = Xk i=1 i, Z0k+1 = Xk+1 i=1 i. (9.29) Denote 2n= Var Sn and let g, h be either x ! cos x or x ! sin x. If lim n!1 1 2nIEZ02 k+1 = 0, lim n!1 1 2n Xk i=1 IE|i|2 = 1, Xk j=2 Cov g   t n Xj?1 i=1 i!, ht n j!! 0, for all t 2 IR, lim n!1 1 2n Xk i=1 IE|i|21I|i|n = 0, for all > 0, then the sequence Sn/n converges in distribution to a Gaussian N(0, 1) distribution. 51
