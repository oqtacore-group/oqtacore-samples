1 Introduction Let (S,A, ?) be a probability space and (k)k2Z be a stationary, ergodic Markov chain with state space S, transition operator Q and stationary distribution ?. It is assumed that (k)k2Z is realized on its own sample path space (, B, P?). Denote by L02the subspace of LR2 (S,A, ?) = L2 consisting of functions with R f d? = 0. Given f 2 L02let Sn(f) = f(1) + . . . + f(n). We will be interested in conditions on f 2 L02under which Sn(f) satisfies the central limit theorem (CLT) Sn(f)/pn n!1 ) N(0, 2(f)), (1) with ESn(f)2/n n!1 ! 2(f). (2) Here N(0, 2) denotes the normal law with mean 0 and variance 2, which in the degenerate case 2 = 0 is equal to the Dirac measure at 0, and ) denotes weak convergence of distributions. Definition 1.1. If for a function f 2 L02, (1) and (2) hold, we say that f is asymptotically normal. Asymptotic normality of functions f 2 L02has been studied intensively in the literature, and we want to review some of the results. A very simple sufficient condition (cf. Gordin & Lif?sic [11]) is the existence of a solution g 2 L2 to the equation f = g ? Qg. (3) If (3) holds, f is asymptotically normal with limit variance given by 2(f) = |g|22? |Qg|22, (4) where | - |2 is the L2-norm. Under the same assumption also the functional central limit theorem (FCLT) holds (see, for instance, Borodin & Ibragimov [1]). Furthermore, we may change P? to the probability measure Ps corresponding to the chain started from a point s 2 S so that 0 = s, and the CLT and FCLT still hold true for almost all s 2 S with respect to ?. In general we may conclude (3) from the convergence in L2 of the series 1Xn=0Qnf. (5) Then we can set g = P1n=0 Qnf. The convergence of (5) implies, in particular, |Qnf|2 ! n!1 0. An obvious sufficient condition under which the series (5) converges is 1Xn=0 |Qnf|2 < 1. (6) However, the assumptions (6) and even (5) seem to be too restrictive, at least for some special classes of transition operators. A bounded operator K in a Hilbert space is called normal if 2
it commutes with its adjoint: KK= KK. Let D denote the closed unit disc in C. Gordin & Lif?sic [12] observed that the condition ZD 1 |1 ? z|f (dz) < 1 (7) is sufficient for f to be asymptotically normal, provided the operator Q is normal. Here f is the spectral measure of f with respect to Q. In this case the formula for the limiting variance 2(f) reads 2(f) = ZD 1 ? |z|2 |1 ? z|2 (dz). (8) Observe that (7) is equivalent to the solvability in L2 of the equation f = (I ? Q)1/2g. (9) The detailed proofs of these results, along with some generalizations and applications, were published by Gordin & Lif?sic in ([1], Ch. 4, Sect. 7-9). See also Derriennic & Lin [3], and for the self-adjoint case, which corresponds to reversible chains, Kipnis & Varadhan [13]. It was assumed in the above mentioned papers that the path space of (k)k2Z is endowed with the stationary measure P?. Under slightly stronger conditions the same conclusion was established in [4] for ??almost all measures Ps, s 2 S, provided that Q is a normal operator. All above mentioned papers used martingale approximation. A natural question now arises whether it is possible to relax the known conditions for the CLT which make sense for arbitrary transition operators (like (5) or (6)). A related problem is to obtain a formula for the limiting variance valid (as (8)) in some cases when (3) has no solution in L2. Recently some results in this direction have been obtained. Maxwell & Woodroofe [15] showed that if f 2 L02satisfies Xn1 n?3/2nX?1 k=0Qkf2 < 1, (10) then f is asymptotically normal. In case |Pn?1 k=0 Qkf|2 = O(n?) for some < 1/2, Derriennic & Lin [6] showed that the FCLT for the Markov chain, started at a point, holds true. Several questions however remain open. We do not know, for example, whether (9) implies the CLT without normality assumptions. It can be shown using the results in [5] that (9) is equivalent to the convergence in L2 of Pn1 n?3/2Pn?1 k=0 Qkf (compare this to (10)). An important class of Markov operators Q is specified by the condition QQ= I. (11) Such operators are sometimes called coisomteries because the adjoint operator Qis an isometry in view of (11). The corresponding class of Markov chains is useful to produce examples of transition operators with properties very far from normal (remark that only those coisomteries are normal which are unitaries; the latter leads to 2(f) = 0 in (16)). This paper is organised as follows. In Section 2, we derive a new sufficient condition for a function f 2 L02to be asymptotically normal. This is applied to certain linear processes. Our main interest is the situation in which there exists an orthogonal splitting LC2 (S,A, ?) = i2IHi 3
invariant under the Markov operator, i.e. QHi Hi for every i. Here I is a countable index set. Evidently, this is the case if Q is normal with discrete spectrum and the Hi correspond to eigenspaces of different eigenvalues. However, there are several other interesting examples, even of coisometries, for which such invariant splittings exist. In Section 3 we prove two conditions, adapted to invariant splittings, under which f is asymptotically normal. The first is related to the condition derived in Section 2, the second to (10) as introduced by Maxwell & Woodroofe [15]. It is shown that these are indeed improvements as compared to the original conditions. Finally, in Section 4, we consider two examples, namely endomorphisms of compact Abelian groups and random walks on compact homogeneous spaces. Let us mention that using invariant splittings, Denker and Gordin [2] proved the FCLT for a certain class of transformations of the two-dimensional torus. In the present paper we consider only discrete splittings. In principle, similar results can be obtained for some splittings with a nontrivial continuous part which is a direct integral of Q?invariant subspaces. For example, this is the case if one considers a random walk on a non compact homogeneous space of finite invariant measure such as SL(2,R)/SL(2,Z). 2 A sufficient condition for the CLT In this section we will prove asymptotic normality for functions f 2 L02which satisfy |Qnf|2 ! n!1 0 (12) and 1Xn=0 Qnf22 ?Qn+1f221/2 < 1. (13) Our discussion is based on the following well-known result, which is contained implicitly in [9], [18] and [1]. Theorem 2.1. Let (k)k2Z be a stationary ergodic Markov chain. Assume that f 2 L02 satisfies lim n!1 sup m0 nX+m k=n Qkf22 ? n+Xm+1 k=n+1 Qkf22= 0 (14) and lim n!1 1nnX?1 k=0Qkf22 = 0. (15) Then f is asymptotically normal with limit variance (f)2 = lim n!1Xn k=0Qkf22 ? nX+1 k=1Qkf22. (16) This will be used to prove the following Theorem 2.2. Let (k)k2Z be a stationary ergodic Markov chain. Assume that f 2 L02satisfies (12) and (13). Then it also satisfies (14) and (15) and consequently, f is asymptotically normal with limit variance 2(f) given in (16). 4
First let us prove two lemmas. Lemma 2.3. For any f 2 L2, n,m 0, n+Xm?1 k=m Qkf22 ? Qn+Xm?1 k=m Qkf22 n+Xm?1 k=m Qkf22 ? Qk+1f221/22. (17) Proof. The map (f, g) 7!< f, g > ? < Qf,Qg > is a non-negative, symmetric bilinear form since Q is a contraction, and hence gives rise to the seminorm ??|f|22?|Qf|22 1/2. Relation (17) now follows by applying the triangle inequality. Lemma 2.4. Assume that f 2 L2 satisfies (12). Then for every n 0, nX?1 k=0Qkf22 = 1Xl=0 nX?1 k=0Qk+lf22 ? nX?1 k=0Qk+l+1f22. (18) Proof. For N > 0 we have nX?1 k=0Qkf22 = NX?1 l=0 nX?1 k=0Qk+lf22 ? QnX?1 k=0Qk+lf22+ QN nX?1 k=0Qkf22. The remainder term vanishes as N ! 1 due to (12). Proof of Theorem 2.2. We want to show that the conditions of Theorem 2.1 hold. From Lemma 2.3 it follows directly that (13) implies (14). In order to show (15), we compute n?1nX?1 k=0Qkf22 = n?1 1Xl=0 nX?1 k=0Qk+lf22 ? QnX?1 k= Qk+lf22n?1 1Xl=0 nX?1 k=0 Qk+lf22 ? Qk+l+1f221/22 n?1 nX?1 k=0 1Xl=0??Qk+lf22 ? Qk+l+1f221/22 = n?1 nX?1 k=0 1Xr=k??Qrf22 ? Qr+1f221/22. (19) Since P1r=k??Qrf22 ? Qr+1f221/2 ! 0, (15) follows. This proves the theorem. Example 2.1 (Linear processes). Let (k)k2Z be a sequence of independent identically distributed random variables with values in R. Let us form a sequence (k)k2Z by setting k = (. . . , k?1, k). This is a Markov sequence with transition operator satisfying (11). Assume that the variables k have second moments and expectation 0. Set f(k) = 1Xj=0 ajk?j , 5
where (aj)j0 is a real sequence satisfying P1j=0 a2j< 1. Then (6) means that 1Xn=0?? 1Xk=n a2k1/2< 1, while (13) only requires 1Xn=0 |ak| < 1. 3 CLT under invariant splittings In this section we study the situation in which there is an orthogonal splitting of the L2-space invariant under the Markov operator. First let us give a general sufficient condition, adapted to an orthogonal splitting, for convergence of a series in a Hilbert space. Let H be a real or complex Hilbert space with norm denoted by k-k and let H = i2IHi be a splitting into closed, orthogonal subspaces, where I is a countable index set. For x 2 H, i 2 I let xi denote the orthogonal projection of x onto Hi, so that x = Pi2I xi. Lemma 3.1. If (xn)n1 H satisfies Xi2I ??Xn1 kxink2 < 1, (20) then the series Pn1 xn converges. This is easily proved using the Cauchy criterion. The next lemma shows that taking into account the orthogonal splitting indeed brings an improvement. Lemma 3.2. Xi2I ??Xn1 kxink2 Xn1 kxnk2. Proof. Since kxnk = ??Pi2I kxink21/2, after expanding both sides, we have to show that X n1,n20Xi2I kxin1kkxin2k | {z } A X n1,n20 ??Xi2I kxin1k21/2??Xi2I kxin2k1/2 | {z } B . This follows since A B from the Schwarz inequality. Corollary 3.3. If there are two splittings H = i2IHi = i02I0Hi0 such that for each i 2 I there is a i0 2 I0 with Hi Hi0 , then Xi2I Xn1 kxink2 Xi02I0 Xn1 kxi0 nk2. (21) 6
Now consider once more a stationary ergodic Markov chain (n)n2Z on (, B, P?) with state space (S,A, ?), transition operator Q and stationary initial distribution ?. Since we have to deal with complex-valued functions, observe that Q also acts as a contraction on LC2 (S,A, ?) and that Qf = Q ? f, where?denotes complex conjugation. Assume that there is a splitting LC2 (S,A, ?) = i2IHi of LC2 (S,A, ?) into closed orthogonal subspaces Hi that are invariant under Q, i.e. QHi Hi. We denote by Qi the restriction of Q to Hi and by fi the orthogonal projection of f 2 LC2 (S,A, ?) onto Hi. An application of Lemma 3.1 immediately gives Proposition 3.4. If f 2 L02satisfies Xi2I Xn0 |Qnifi|22 < 1, (22) then the series (5) converges and consequently, f is asymptotically normal. This result will be improved in two ways. Firstly, we give a criterion analogously to (13) modified to the context of invariant splittings. Observe that Lemmas 2.3 and 2.4 remain true for complex valued f. Theorem 3.5. Let (k)k2Z be a stationary ergodic Markov chain. Assume that LC2 (S,A, ?) = i2IHi is a splitting into orthogonal closed subspaces Hi that are invariant under the transition operator Q. If f 2 L02, f = Pi2I fi with fi 2 Hi satisfies (12) and Xi2I 1Xn=0 Qnifi22 ?Qn+1 i fi221/22 < 1, (23) then it also satisfies (14) and (15) and consequently, f is asymptotically normal with limit variance 2(f) given by (16). Remark 3.1. If there exists an invariant splitting, Lemma 3.2 means that (23) is a weaker condition than (13), where this splitting is not taken into account. Furthermore, by (21), the finer the splitting in (23), the weaker the condition. If the splitting is finite (i.e. I is finite), (23) and (13) are in fact equivalent. Similar comments apply to (24) as compared with (10). Proof of Theorem 3.5. If (23) holds, then using Lemma 2.3 sup n1 n+m?1 Xk=m Qkf22 ? Qn+Xm?1 k=m Qkf22= sup n1Xi2I n+Xm?1 k=m Qkifi22 ? Qi n+Xm?1 k=m Qkifi22Xi2I sup n1 n+Xm?1 k=m Qkifi22 ? Qi n+Xm?1 k=m Qkifi22Xi2I 1Xk=mQkifi22 ? Qk+1 i fi221/22, 7
and this tends to 0 as m ! 1. If in addition (12) holds, then from (19) it follows that n?1nX?1 k=0Qkf22 = n?1Xi2I nX?1 k=0Qkifi22 n?1Xi2I nX?1 k=0 1Xr=k??Qrifi22 ? Qr+1 i fi221/22 = n?1 nX?1 k=0Xi2I 1Xr=k??Qrifi22 ? Qr+1 i fi221/22 which once more tends to 0. This proves the theorem. Now we will put (10) into the context of invariant splittings. Consider the subspaces of LC2 (,A, P?) defined by H0 i = {f(X1) ? Qf(X0), f 2 Hi, i 2 I}. From E??f(X1) ? (Qf)(X0)??g(X1) ? (Qg)(X0)=< f, g > ? < Qf, Qg >, f, g 2 LC2 (S,A, ?), it follows that for different i 2 I these spaces are orthogonal in LC2 (,A, P?), and hence so are their closures. Denote Vn(f) = nX?1 k=0Qkf, f 2 LC2 (S,A, ?). For the proof of the next theorem we rely heavily on results from Maxwell & Woodroofe [15]. Theorem 3.6. Let (k)k2Z be a stationary ergodic Markov chain. Assume that LC2 (S,A, ?) = i2IHi is a splitting into orthogonal closed subspaces Hi that are invariant under the transition operator Q. Assume that f 2 L02, f = Pi2I fi with fi 2 Hi satisfies Xi2I Xn1 |Vn(fi)|2/n3/22 < 1. (24) Then f is asymptotically normal. Proof. For the proof we depend on several facts from Maxwell & Woodroofe [15]. Our goal is to obtain a representation Sn(f) = Mn + An, n 1, where (Mn) is a martingale with stationary increments w.r.t. Fn = (k, k n), and EA2n/n ! 0. Asymptotic normality of f is then immediate. Given > 0 set g= ((1 + )I ? Q)?1f, so that (1 + )g? Qg= f. Then Sn(f) = Mn,+ Sn(g) + An,, (25) where Mn,= Xn k=1 ??g(Xk) ? (Qg)(Xk?1), An,= (Qg)(X0) ? (Qg)(Xn). 8
We want to show that - Sn(g) ! 0, Mn,! Mn and An,! An, ! 0 in L2(,A, P?), (26) where (Mn)n1 and (An)n1 have the properties specified above. For this it suffices to show that 1. kgk2 ! 0, ! 0, 2. (M1,n)n1, with n = 1/2n, converges as n ! 1 in L2(,A, P?), see [15]. To show |g|22! 0, observe that g=Xi2I gi, gi= ((1 + )I ? Q)?1fi 2 Hi. In [15] it is shown that with k = 1/2k, Xk1pk sup k<k?1 |gi|2 CXn1 |Vnfi|2/n3/2 (27) where C > 0 from now on denotes a generic constant. In particular, |gi|22! 0, ! 0 and p|gi|2 CXn1 |Vnfi|2/n3/2 8 > 0. (28) Since |g|22=Xi2I |gi|22, (29) it follows from (28) and (24) that the right side of (29) is dominated by a convergent series. Therefore lim !0 |g|22=Xi2I lim !0 |gi|22= 0. Next we want to show that M1,= g(X1) ? Qg(X0) converges to a limit in L2(,A, P?) along the sequence n. To this end notice that M1,=Xi2I Mi1,, Mi1,= gi(X1) ? Qgi(X0) 2 H0 i , is an orthogonal decomposition in LC2 (,A, P?). We have M1,n =Xn k=1(M1,k ?M1,k?1) +M1,0 . In [15] it is shown that 1Xn=1 kMi1,n ?Mi1,n?1kLC2(,A,P?) CXn1 |Vn(fi)|2/n3/2. (30) 9
From (30) and (24) it follows that Xi2I Xn1 kMi1,n ?Mi1,n?1kLC2(,A,P?)2 < 1, and therefore we can apply Lemma 3.1 to obtain convergence of the series Pn1(M1,n ? M1,n?1) and hence that of M1,n. This concludes the proof of the theorem. The following corollary is easily deduced. Corollary 3.7. A function f 2 L02satisfies (24) if Xi2I Xn0 |Qnifi|2 pn + 12 < 1. (31) Remark 3.2. It can be shown that if (24) holds, the limits 2(fi) = limn!1 E|Mi1,n|2, i 2 I, exist and 2(f) =Xi2I 2(fi). 4 Examples In this section we consider two examples in which the Markov operator admits an invariant splitting in the sense of Section 3. In case of a normal operator with discrete spectrum and the canonical decomposition of LC2 (S,A, ?) into eigenspaces of distinct eigenvalues, (23), (24) and (31) are stronger requirements than (7). However, there are other interesting examples of such invariant splittings. Firstly we consider exact endomorphisms of compact Abelian groups. Here the transfer operator, evidently a coisometry, plays the role of the Markov operator Q. Furthermore we study random walks on compact homogeneous spaces. Recall that a measure-preserving transformation T of a probability space (S,A, ?) is called exact (cf. Rohlin [16]) if the -field T1n=0 T?nA is trivial. Example 4.1 (Exact group endomorphisms). The central limit theorem for the following class of transformations was studied by Leonov [14] using moment-based arguments. Let T : G ! G be an endomorphism of a compact separable Abelian group G. Denote by ?G the normalized Haar measure. Let ?? be the dual group consisting of characters, which form an orthonormal basis of LC2 (G, ?G) (cf. Rudin [17]). Denote T= T, then Tis a homomorphism of ??. We have the following relations between T and T. : T surjective , Tinjective. : T exact , Tn1 Tn?? = {0}. Indeed, if T is onto, then Tis evidently injective. On the other hand, T is onto if and only if f T = g T ) f = g 8 f, g 2 LC2 (G, ?G). 10
Since Tis injective, the equality f T =X2?? < f, > T=X2?? < g, > T= g T implies < f, >=< g, > and hence f = g. Furthermore exactness of T is equivalent to E(f| T?nB) ! Ef in LC2 (G, ?G), where f is considered as a random variable on (G,A, ?G), and A denotes the Borel sigmaalgebra of G. But if f = P2?? < f, > we have that E(f| T?nB) = X 2Tn?? < f, > , and the second equivalence follows. From now on we assume that T is onto and exact. The group ?? can be partitioned into grand orbits defined by O() = {2 ?? : 9 n,m 0 : Tn= Tm}. We assume that G is infinite, so that ?? is countably infinite. We claim that there exists a countably infinite set ???such that the different grand orbits (except for the trivial orbit {1}) are given by {?, T?, T2 ?, . . .}, ?2 ???. (32) In fact, set ???= ?? \ T?? (here \ is the set-theoretic difference). Since T?? is an infinite subgroup 6= ??, ???must also be infinite. Since Tis injective, the sets in (32) are indeed grand orbits. If has no first predecessor, then for every n 0 there is a 2 ?? such that Tn= , which would imply 2 Tn0 Tn??, a contradiction to exactness. We obtain a splitting L02= ?2???L2(?), (33) where L2(?) denotes the closure of the subspace generated by O(?). Let UT : LC2 (G, ?G) ! LC2 (G, ?G), UT f = f T. Evidently, UT preserves the splitting (33), and hence the same holds for its dual, the transfer operator, denoted by VT . On the components of the splitting, VT acts as left shift. More precisely, if f =Xn0 < f, Tn ?> Tn ?for some ?2 ???, then VT f =Xn0 < f, Tn+1 ?> Tn ?. Let (n)n2Z be a Markov chain with stationary distribution ?G and transition operator VT . Then (UnT f)n0 is a time reversal of ??f(n)n0, i.e. ??f(0), . . . , f(n)??UnT f, . . . , f, n 0, where means that the random vectors are equal in distribution. Therefore an application of Theorem 3.5 with Q = VT gives 11
Theorem 4.1 (Leonov, 1964). Suppose that f 2 L02satisfies XO X2O | < f, > |2 < 1 (34) where the first sum is taken over all grand orbits. Then the sequence n?1/2Pn?1 k=0 f Tn is asymptotically normal with variance 2(f) =XO X2O < f, >2. The formula for the limit variance is deduced using (16). Leonov [14] in fact considered general ergodic group endomorphisms. Theorem 4.1 can be derived from his results when restricting to the case of an exact endomorphism. As a particular example, consider G = T1, the 1-torus, and let Tx = 2x mod 1. Then the dual group is isomorphic to Z, and grand orbits can be indexed by odd numbers and {?2, 2}. Example 4.2 (Random walks on compact homogeneous spaces). Let G be a locally compact second countable group and let K be a closed subgroup such that the homogeneous space X = G/K of left cosets with the quotient topology is compact. We assume that K is a unimodular group and that the left invariant Haar measure on G is also invariant with respect to the right action of K (in particular, this is the case if both G and K are unimodular). Under these assumptions, there exists a unique probability measure ? on X invariant with respect to the natural action of G on X given by (g, x) 7! gx, x = hK. Denote by = X the unitary representation of G in LC2 (X, ?) defined by ??(g)f(x) = f(g?1x), x 2 X, f 2 LC2 (X, ?). Assume that for every R continuous function on G with compact support the operator G (g)(g)dg is a compact operator on LC2 (X, ?) (the integration over g is performed respective to the left invariant Haar measure on G). This holds true e.g. for discrete K (cf. [10], p. 21) and for compact G. Then the representation can be decomposed into a sum of countably many irreducible unitary representations of G where any such representation occurs with finite multiplicity. The proof for the case of discrete K can be found in ([10], Sect. 2.3), however, discreteness is only used to obtain compactness of the operators RG (g)(g)dg and therefore the proof also works under our assumptions. In principle our results apply to this splitting of into irreducible representations. However, since this splitting is not canonic, our conditions from Section 3 for a specific function f 2 L02 to satisfy the CLT depend on the particular choice of the splitting. A more satisfactory way is to pass to a coarser splitting of X given by X = 2Irr(X). (35) Here Irr(X) denotes the set of equivalence classes of irreducible unitary representations of G which realize as subrepresentations of X, and = X,is the primary (or isotipic) subrepresentation of of type , that is, is a maximal subrepresentation of every irreducible subrepresentation of which is equivalent to . Every can be decomposed into some number m(called multiplicity) of copies of . Unlike the decomposition of into 12
irreducible representations, its decomposition (35) into primary components is canonic. Let Hdenote the subspace of LC2 (X, ?) the representation acts on, and denote by fthe orthogonal projection of f onto H. If Q is a Borel probability measure on G, then it induces a Markov operator on LC2 (X, ?) given by Qf(x) = ZG f(g?1x)dQ(g), x 2 X, f 2 LC2 (X, ?). This Markov operator preserves ?, and since the spaces Hare invariant under the representation X, they are also invariant under Q. Therefore an application of Corollary 3.7 gives Theorem 4.2. Let (n)n2Z be a random walk on the compact homogeneous space X = G/K with transition operator Q and stationary distribution ?, as specified above. If Q is ergodic and if f 2 L02satisfies X 2Irr(X) Xn0 |Qnf|2 pn + 1 2 < 1, (36) then the sequence pn?1Pn?1 k=0 f(k) is asymptotically normal with variance 2(f) = lim n!1 1nEnX?1 k=0 f(k)2. Let us consider more explicitly the case of a compact group G. We denote by ?G the normalised Haar measure on G and by ?Gthe set of equivalence classes of unitary irreducible representations of G. Since G is compact, each 2 ?Gis finite dimensional (cf. [8], p. 74). We let 2 ?Galso stand for some representative of its equivalence class, acting on the vector space Vof dimension n. The character of is given by (g) = tr??(g), where tr denotes the trace of the corresponding automorphism of V. Let be a subrepresentation of the left regular representation G of G (where G(g)f(-) = f(g?1-), f 2 LC2 (G, ?G), g 2 G). It decomposes canonically into a sum = 2Irr()of isotipic subrepresentations, and the orthogonal projection of f 2 H to His given by f= nf . Now consider a closed subgroup K of G (possibly the trivial subgroup {1}), and as above let X = G/K be corresponding compact homogeneous space. The spaces LC2 (X, ?) and LK2(G, ?G) = {f 2 LC2 (G, ?G) : f(gk) = f(g) for all k 2 K}, the subspace of LC2 (G, ?G) consisting of functions which are right-invariant under K, are isometric (cf. [8], p. 101). Therefore LC2 (X, ?) may be considered as a subspace of LC2 (G, ?G), and X as a subrepresentation of G. Thus we have the above formula for the orthogonal projections fof f 2 LC2 (X, ?) onto HX,. A representation 2 ?Goccurs in Irr(X) if and only if dimV K > 0, where V K = {v 2 V: (k)v = v for all k 2 K}. In fact, the multiplicity of in X,is given by m= dim V K . On LK2(G, ?G), the operator Q is simply the convolution Qf = Q f. Finally let us mention that for Q having finite support, the CLT for a random walk on a compact homogeneous space was established by Dolgopyat ([7], p. 193). 13
